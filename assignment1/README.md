Zip's law is law obtained from observation from the data. It states that in a corpus the rank of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency. It can further be related to the length and the meaning of words, where the length is proportional to rank and meaning is related to frequency as a square root of frequency.

Heap's law tells how the overall vocabulary(types) grows with the size of the corpus.

The repository discuss the implementation of the TTR(type/token ratio), verification of Zipf's law for length, meaning and rank versus frequency of occurrence.After that implementation of Heap's law is discussed and estimation of the parameters related to equation is done using curve fitting.

All the implementation are done using python libraries like nltk, scipy, matplotlib, etc.
