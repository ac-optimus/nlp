years  and as lord st  simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor  it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress   ', 'crime is common ', ' it is  of course  well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors ', ' well then   said he   my real name is james ryder  ', '

upper swandam lane ', ' i am naturally observant  as you may have remarked  mr  holmes  and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head ', 'as i ran down the passage  my sister s door was unlocked  and revolved slowly upon its hinges ', 'by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening  her face blanched with terror  her hands groping for help  her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard ', ' how did you know  for example  that i did manual labour ', '  in the case of another   said he   the objection might be fatal  but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours ', ' there are three men waiting for him at the door   said holmes ', ' now  mr  holder   said holmes   here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost ', 'by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood  and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer  by whom he now has two children ', ' miss roylott  you have not ', ' you have a maid who has a sweetheart ', ' he is looking up at the numbers of the houses  ', 'we shall soon see how he managed it  ', 'does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy  who appears to have had little of his own  and to have been under such obligations to turner  should still talk of marrying his son to turner s daughter  who is  presumably  heiress to the estate  and that in such a very cocksure manner  as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow ', ' this is the envelope   he continued ', 'this business has had a very bad effect upon him ', 'they were admirable things for the observer  excellent for drawing the veil from men s motives and actions ', ' very murderous indeed  ', 'he was a small  wiry  sunburnt man  clean shaven  with a sharp face and alert manner ', 'we could write in the meantime  and he used to write every day ', ' i will fly  mr  holmes ', ' you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me  ', 'i believe that he foresaw some danger  or else he would not have talked so ', 'in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn  which is a small public house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn ', '  quite so ', ' what have you to say now  ', 'can you suggest no explanation  ', ' that s the worst of it  mr  holmes  i don t know  ', 'the ring  after all  proves nothing ', 'as regards your hair  it is no doubt a pity  especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview  but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point  and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss ', 'the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes ', 'we should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den ', ' my dear holmes   said i   this is too much ', 'then suddenly he plunged forward  wrung my hand  and congratulated me warmly on my success ', 'but  cooee  is a distinctly australian cry  and one which is used between australians ', ' i see ', 'holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and  leaning back with his hands in his pockets  began talking  rather to himself  as it seemed  than to us ', 'bankers  safes had been forced before now  and why should not mine be ', 'he has a passion also for indian animals  which are sent over to him by a correspondent  and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon  which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master ', ' quite so   he answered  lighting a cigarette  and throwing himself down into an armchair ', ' married ', 'passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river  and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street ', ' not at all ', ' eight weeks passed away like this  and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica  and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b s before very long ', ' i did not know ', '  yes  thief  ', 'we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady  but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph ', 'that is suggestive ', 'fritz  ', 'i could not hear a sound  not even the drawing of a breath  and yet i knew that my companion sat open eyed  within a few feet of me  in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself ', ' oh  i m in such trouble  ', 'chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem  and its solution is its own reward ', ' it may seem to point very straight to one thing  but if you shift your own point of view a little  you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different ', 'we got off  paid our fare  and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead ', ' well  when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr  jabez wilson s presence  in other words  that they had completed their tunnel ', ' coming on the top of such a damning series of events  it was at least a most suspicious remark  ', 'chubb lock to the door ', 'i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance  and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time ', 'i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room  ', ' my mary ', ' there is the gravel drive  and there are the rose bushes where i lay ', 'i think myself that it is a page from some private diary ', ' not in the least  ', ' where  indeed  ', 'such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister  ', 'i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha  ', 'if she had  it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely ', 'sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick  all comprehensive glances ', ' nothing to complain of  sir ', 'what a time it seemed ', '  no  i had a feeling something was there  ', 'in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr  grimesby roylott s death  and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience  ', 'my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown  looking over my shoulder ', 'he slipped his key into the lock  and we all very quietly entered the cell ', 'there must have been several in it  and they must have been men of resource and determination ', ' it is a swamp adder  ', 'the other clothes would have followed  but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair  and a few minutes after i found  rather  i confess  to my relief  that instead of being identified as mr  neville st  clair  i was arrested as his murderer ', ' i came to you  sir  because i heard of you from mrs  etherege  whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead ', 'it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties ', ' your majesty must pay ', 'i confess that i was disappointed ', ' how did he come  ', 'my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match  and we are to be married in the course of the spring ', ' let me introduce you   he shouted   to mr  neville st  clair  of lee  in the county of kent  ', ' we both thought the best resource was flight  when pursued by so formidable an antagonist  so you will find the nest empty when you call to morrow ', 'when i rose from my father i looked round for it  but it was gone ', 'about this girl  miss holder ', ' my geese  ', 'he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke  and took out  to my astonishment  a very large bath sponge ', ' entirely  ', 'this woman might  for all i knew  be a monomaniac ', 'boots had then run down the lane  and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt ', ' hum  ', 'she is four and twenty  ', 'this press  as i have already explained  has got out of order  and we wish your advice upon the subject ', 'i presume that i may take it as correct  this article  for example  as to the disappearance of the bride  ', 'your windows would be visible from there  ', ' then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out ', 'could your patients spare you for a few hours  ', 'asked holmes ', ' it may not come to that   said holmes ', 'on the right side was a small wooden thicket  which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door  and forming the tradesmen s entrance ', ' it is a little cold for the time of the year   said holmes ', 'mr  rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother ', ' very naturally ', 'i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn 700 pounds a year  which is less than my average takings  but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up  and also in a facility of repartee  which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city ', ' and have you any on hand just now  ', 'be one of them  and you will know all that there is to know ', 'asked the king hoarsely ', ' no  we don t keep a cat ', 'i braved him to do his worst ', ' it means that it is all over   holmes answered ', 'i may want your help  and so may he ', ' my god ', ' pray sit down on the sofa   said holmes gently ', 'why  bless my soul ', 'i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks  which i took to be the police  but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me ', ' i did not say a probable one ', ' and i am for north   said i   because there are no hills there  and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any  ', 'he said the folk were not fit for us to know  when all father s friends were to be there ', ' you had my note  ', 'the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates  and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him ', 'do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence   this account of you we have from all quarters received  ', 'his slow  limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude  and yet his hard  deep lined  craggy features  and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character ', 'it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers  ', ' think of my father ', ' oh  so so ', 'very retiring and gentlemanly he was ', ' why  it is after nine now   i answered ', 'the window was open  and she distinctly saw his face  which she describes as being terribly agitated ', 'men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him ', ' i was also aware of that   murmured holmes  settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes ', 'he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases  and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation  ', 'i thought there might be some weapon or other trace ', 'you will leave the papers here  and remember the advice which i have given you ', 'he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear  with my hands on the testament  that whatever happened i would always be true to him ', 'it was not mere curiosity  though i have my share of that ', 'so there were quarrels  and this  i am sure  was one of them  ', '  oh  just as you like   said she  a little huffed ', ' i have been waiting so eagerly for you   she cried  shaking hands with us warmly ', 'there are grounds round it  woods on three sides  and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad  which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door ', 'here we are  and they are waiting for us  ', ' this  i take it  belongs to the room in which you used to sleep  the centre one to your sister s  and the one next to the main building to dr  roylott s chamber  ', 'in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there  an old briar pipe between his lips  his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling  the blue smoke curling up from him  silent  motionless  with the light shining upon his strong set aquiline features ', ' yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound  and that the door  window  and chimney are impassable  then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end  ', ' i came to find a friend  ', 'i am somewhat of a fowl fancier  and i have seldom seen a better grown goose  ', ' oh  sir  you are the very man whom i have longed to meet   cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers ', 'if this fail  i shall have recourse to other methods  ', 'it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope  or so we may call it  since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull  ', ' that hurts my pride  watson   he said at last ', 'at the church door  however  they separated  he driving back to the temple  and she to her own house ', ' that s it  ', ' as it happens  he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business ', ' nay  he was bringing home the goose as a peace offering to his wife ', 'i know i ought to have spoken to lord st  simon  but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people ', 'said he   this is treasure trove indeed ', 'five little livid spots  the marks of four fingers and a thumb  were printed upon the white wrist ', 'swiftly i threw off my clothes  pulled on those of a beggar  and put on my pigments and wig ', ' a pair  by the sound   said he ', ' oh  it is childish ', 'he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown  a pipe rack within his reach upon the right  and a pile of crumpled morning papers  evidently newly studied  near at hand ', ' ha ', 'you must have started early  and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart  along heavy roads  before you reached the station  ', 'hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day  and he had come back  twitching and shattered  in the evening ', 'but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard  which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh  will answer your purpose equally well  ', ' your red headed idea was very new and effective  ', ' and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year  with what you earn into the bargain  you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way ', ' you will be the ruin of us ', 'i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal  ', ' we never thought that she would have been so carried away  ', ' you have but to name it  ', ' i hardly think that likely ', ' when he was gone i unlocked my bureau  made sure that my treasure was safe  and locked it again ', 'it was a quarter past six when we left baker street  and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue ', ' here it is  ', 'now  when you see that a young lady  otherwise neatly dressed  has come away from home with odd boots  half buttoned  it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry  ', 'we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked  ', ' how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell ', ' why is he silent  then  if he is innocent  ', ' well  when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished  as you may both think  at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me ', 'the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you ', ' perhaps you had better not speak of the matter ', ' no sign of it  ', 'i know all about mccarthy  ', ' yes ', 'on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick  and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake ', ' on monday  ', 'we stepped  as it were  right out of the carriage and into the hall  so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house ', 'he took a step backward  cocked his head on one side  and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful ', 'i leave it with you  however  with every confidence  and i shall call for it in person on monday morning  ', ' but she will refuse  ', 'the place we want must be somewhere near that line ', 'we found him  when we went to search for him  face downward in a little green scummed pool  which lay at the foot of the garden ', ' yes  i saw it by the side lights when i was stepping into the carriage ', 'i then hurried forward  and found him standing by the pool ', ' oh  no  no ', 'you quite follow me  ', ' now  it is a fact  gentlemen  as you may see for yourselves  that my hair is of a very full and rich tint  so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met ', ' she is of a quiet nature ', ' how are you getting on  ', ' oh  he has his faults  too   said mr  wilson ', 'to be left till called for  ', 'it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter  and i should     his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left ', 'you took me in completely ', ' you would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them  ', ' it saved me from ennui   he answered  yawning ', 'a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me ', ' but the mystery  ', ' remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein  and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills  ', 'if you leave  you forfeit your whole position forever ', 'i have never denied him a wish ', 'i yelled ', 'i can only say  madam  that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend ', ' you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me   i remarked ', 'she was rather above the middle height  slim  with dark hair and eyes  which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin ', 'impossible  ', 'there is one remarkable point  however  which will no doubt strike you  ', 'it was not a common thing for him to receive letters  for his bills were all paid in ready money  and he had no friends of any sort ', ' the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china ', 'this is what he says     my dear mr  sherlock holmes   lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion ', '  perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes   said he  throwing open another door ', 'i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you  ', ' were you engaged to the gentleman at this time  ', 'might i ask you a question or two  ', 'sherlock holmes staggered back  white with chagrin and surprise ', 'i do not know what i could do without her ', ' but not more so than i to find you  ', 'i can see him now  with yellow  pasty face  drooping lids  and pin point pupils  all huddled in a chair  the wreck and ruin of a noble man ', 'i know some of them ', 'i think that was the chain of events  mr ', ' smart fellow  that   observed holmes as we walked away ', ' he seems a very amiable person   said holmes  laughing ', 'i had not gone more than 150 yards  however  when i heard a hideous outcry behind me  which caused me to run back again ', 'you need not  however  go to the expense of purchasing one  as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice  now in philadelphia   which would  i should think  fit you very well ', 'i tell you that ', ' well  i have drawn my circle  and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found  ', 'easier the other way  perhaps  and yet  had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me ', ' i will get her to show me  ', 'it is a cold night  and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ', 'her boots i didn t observe ', ' your reasoning is certainly plausible  ', ' you have given me fresh life and hope ', ' what  then  did peterson do  ', ' yes  it must be so ', 'i knelt beside him for some minutes  and then made my way to mr  turner s lodge keeper  his house being the nearest  to ask for assistance ', 'ah ', 'i have some account of the matter here  i believe  ', 'if the latter  it was less likely ', ' because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed ', 'the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish ', 'do you not yourself think that he is innocent  ', 'i m sure i beg pardon ', ' but the letter had also a greater

opened a pocket book and took out a note ', 'this incident gives zest to our investigation  however  and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her ', 'well  then  here on this page are the country folk  and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger ', 'it seemed funny that i should ask his leave  as he was only a few years older than me  but i didn t want to do anything on the sly  so i wrote to father at bordeaux  where the company has its french offices  but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding  ', ' no  it is not even attached to a wire ', 'his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face  as silent as mrs  rucastle and much less amiable ', 'she lives quietly  sings at concerts  drives out at five every day  and returns at seven sharp for dinner ', 'at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect  with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock coat  a picture of offended dignity ', 'sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder ', 'he was a large man with rounded shoulders  a massive head  and a broad  intelligent face  sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown ', 'within are the very words which were upon my father s last message   k ', 'lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look ', 'she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom ', 'you do not know

measured for it ', 'what do you deduce from that  ', ' then we had a talk as to what we should do  and frank was all for openness  but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again  just sending a line to pa  perhaps  to show him that i was alive ', 'and off he went  this trusty tout  without even giving me time to thank him ', ' oh  but he had only picked it up to look at it ', 'we can do nothing until seven o clock ', ' i have been too busy to think of food  and i am likely to be busier still this evening ', 'the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also  from his point of view  be an advantage ', 'not even your skill can inform me where she is now  ', ' i should be very glad now to go upstairs   said he ', 'i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected ', 'it is just possible  however  that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation ', ' in what way  ', 'james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister  but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet  and  and  well  he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet ', '  ample  ', ' and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane  ', 'all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness  gently waving his long  thin fingers in time to the music  while his gently smiling face and his languid  dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth hound  holmes the relentless  keen witted  ready handed criminal agent  as it was possible to conceive ',

square  gaping hole  through which streamed the light of a lantern ', 'said he   you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word  my dear young lady ', ' is a tall man  left handed  limps with the right leg  wears thick soled shooting boots and a grey cloak  smokes indian cigars  uses a cigar holder  and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket ', ' my heart had turned to lead ', 'it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone  ', 'a groan of disappointment came up from below  and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager ', 'i have driven down to tell you so ', 'she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way  with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned ', 'there would be a noise like a pistol shot ', 'between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip  which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water ', 'at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement ', 'an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it  which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator ', 'he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire  and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence ', ' the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder  the game keeper  lost sight of them ', 'because he limped  he was lame  ', ' i will do it  ', 'you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in ', 'it is all dark to me  ', '  but was there another with a barred tail  ', 'it was an ideal spring day  a light blue sky  flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east ', 'he is round in the stable lane now  ', 'was it to be in church  ', 'but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st  simon and his wedding  ', 'this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens ', 'by the way  doctor  i shall want your co operation  ', 'i call him father  though it sounds funny  too  for he is only five years and two months older than myself  ', 'i know that james didn t do it ', 'i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son ', 'i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully ', 'it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light  for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr  grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth ', 'it is the vilest murder trap on the whole riverside  and i fear that neville st  clair has entered it never to leave it more ', 'holmes walked slowly up and down the ill trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows ', ' then that explains what the girl said  ', 'his grip has been upon me these twenty years  and he has blasted my life ', 'however  when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others  and he closed the door as we entered  so that he might have a private word with us ', ' it is true ', 'this note i had this morning marks my zero point  i fancy ', ' one of his hands  ', 'the bridge  no doubt  was too crowded  even on such a night  for their purpose ', 'the walls were carefully sounded  and were shown to be quite solid all round  and the flooring

that he was all i had to love ', 'everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him  ', 'the goose  sir  ', ' i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so ', ' they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure   said he   but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me ', 'and yet  well ', 'now  how can that be unless it were by a left handed man ', 'if i remember rightly  you on one occasion  in the early days of our friendship  defined my limits in a very precise fashion  ', ' without  however  the knowledge of pre existing cases which serves me so well ', 'it is founded upon the observation of trifles  ', '  you doubt its value  ', 'i have already arranged what is to occur ', 'as i waited  i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it ', 'my god ', ' i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take  ', ' it is a question of hydraulics  you see  and came within my own province  ', ' and i say east   said my patient ', 'sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table ', ' he s quicker at climbing down holes than i am ', 'hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament  and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding ', ' i saw her in conversation with her maid  ', 'if you could send her into the cellar on some errand  and then turn the key upon her  you would facilitate matters immensely  ', ' no bad  ', ' yes  and i have no doubt that is her ring  ', ' i do not know what to think ', 'turning round we saw a little rat faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp  while

assizes  so it matters little to me  but i should wish to spare alice the shock ', 'it was a beautiful moonlight night  and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day

english counties in our short drive  starting in middlesex  passing over an angle of surrey  and ending in kent ', ' holmes  the busybody  ', 'i snatched it up and examined it ', 'i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller s earth in one of my fields ', ' i am going right on  ', ' and who could it be who was her confederate ', ' and leave your case unfinished  ',

quotes balzac once ', 'that is important ', 'we feed him once a day  and not too much then  so that he is always as keen as mustard ', ' yes  ', 'then i rang the bell  and  as i hoped  the assistant answered it ', 'it was the bisulphate of baryta  ', ' you had my note  ', ' quite so ', 'you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm  ', ' about a month then  ', ' very ', 'that trick of staining the fishes  scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china ', 'with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him ', 'the lash  however  was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord ', ' he s gone for the dog  ', 'i might at any moment be seized and searched  and there would be the stone in my waistcoat

the wedding ceremony  the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home ', ' what is the young man s own account of the matter  ', ' your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me   i observed ', 'have you a family  ', ' certainly  ', 'colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door ', 'but i shall return by the twelve o clock

he has a gentleman staying with him  a patient  as i understand  who is a foreigner  and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm  ', ' your own little income   he asked   does it come out of the business  ', 'you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr  roylott s cigar ', 'you said ten miles  i think  sir  ', ' that is also quite modern   said the lady ', 'said he  with something of a german accent ', ' the further points  that he is middle aged  that his hair is grizzled  that it has been recently cut  and that he uses lime cream  are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining ', ' no  no  the real name   said holmes sweetly ', ' yes  sir ', 'eventually  in the year 1869  the movement rather suddenly collapsed  although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date  ', 'in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed ', 'his face was bent downward  his shoulders bowed  his lips compressed  and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long  sinewy neck ', 'some woman came talking something or other about lord st  simon to me  seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also  but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank ', ' convinced that something was amiss with him  she rushed down the steps  for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to night  and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor ', 'you said it should not be again ', 'i know the military neatness which characterises you ', 'to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged ', 'the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round  with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge ', ' what did you go into the pool for  ', 'there are only two  a man and his wife ', 'i cried ', 'for christ s sake  don t  ', 'that was the name  style  and abode of my morning visitor ', ' oh  yes  i am not joking   he continued  seeing my look of incredulity ', 'he relapsed into a moody silence  which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue ', 'as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight ', ' see that you keep yourself out of my grip   he snarled  and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room ', 'some  too  have baffled his analytical skill  and would be  as narratives  beginnings without an ending  while others have been but partially cleared up  and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him ', 'my room at the cedars is a double bedded one  ', 'he has been a disappointment

maid and her sweetheart  of whom you had already spoken to me  and inquiry showed it was so ', ' ha  ', ' it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated   said holmes ', 'asked sherlock holmes  with his finger tips together and his eyes to the ceiling ', 'i left the house a little after eight o clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work ', ' and  indeed  i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him  for he has frequently brought him to my house  and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner ', 'take your pistol  and we will enter dr  roylott s room  ', ' good evening ', ' it is a little off the beaten track  isn t it  ', ' well  father was going off to france again in a week

quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind ', ' anything else  ', 'might i not escort her to this place ', 'i put on my hat and cloak  went down to the office  which is about half a mile from the house  and then returned  feeling very much easier ', 'it was pierced in the brim for a hat securer  but the elastic was missing ', 'to take the first example to hand  i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side  and yet i question whether mr  lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that  ', 'and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy ', 'when he told us of a man in a pew  of the change in the bride s manner  of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet  of her resort to her confidential maid  and of her very significant allusion to claim jumping  which in miners  parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to  the whole situation became absolutely clear ', 'it s a wicked world  and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all ', 'when i have spun the web they may take the flies  but not before  ', 'i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church ', 'i could  however  see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing ', 'then i walked across to the window  hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country side  but an oak shutter  heavily barred  was folded across it ', 'it might or might not bite the occupant  perhaps she might escape every night for a week  but sooner or later she must fall a victim ', ' subtle enough and horrible enough ', ' and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards  ', ' this gentleman  ', 'if you two will take the first hansom  watson and i will follow in the second  ', ' oh  a few minutes ', 'with my body in one easy chair and my legs upon another  i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last  saturated with the news of the day  i tossed them all aside and lay listless  watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend s noble correspondent could be ', 'he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad  ', 'i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that  though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other  they were really odd ones  the one having a slightly decorated toe cap  and the other a plain one ', ' when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me ', ' oh  yes  sir  i have only just left him  ', 'if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you  you would not object to our little whim ', 'i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear ', 'he sprang round  and i could see in the gas light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face ', ' and perhaps  after all  it is for the best ', ' i am all attention  madam  ', ' it is k  k  k

ear ', 'an examination showed that one of the india rubber bands which was round the head of a driving rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked ', 'she asked ', 'my

cup   i feared as much ', 'she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep ', 'do you think that you could perform one more feat ', 'therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime

that it was full of papers  ', 'the puny plot of the story was so thin  however  when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping  and i found my attention wander so continually from

upon it  ', 'she was bound to have me in ', 'she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married  and  to tell the truth  the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so

devoted some little attention ', ' well  there seems to me to be only one possible solution ', ' because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance ', 'sir george burnwell tried to get

such a temptation  ', ' i was certainly surprised to find you there  ', 'the matter is a perfectly trivial one   he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat   but there are points in

roared  shaking him by the shoulder ', ' oh  you may carry that feeling away with you ', 'i have given you all the facts ', 'i found her to be a silent  pale faced woman  much younger than her husband

just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars ', 'the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night s adventure  and i sprang to my feet

the door ', ' you will excuse my beginning without you  watson   said he   but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning  ', 'perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion  ', 'and what conclusions did the coroner come to  ', ' yes  ', 'holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary  heavy lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature  while i sat opposite to him  and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us ', 'one morning  at a little before seven o clock  i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting room ', 'her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger ', ' yes  from horsham  ', 'looking over his shoulder  i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck  and a large curling red feather in a broad brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear ', 'he had  as it appears  been returning from fareham in the twilight  and as the country was unknown to him  and the chalk pit unfenced  the

', 'so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered  and had almost come to believe that mrs  st  clair had been deluded when  with a cry  she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it ', 'he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies  and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble covered land which represent the family estate  and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents  wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end ', ' i could hardly believe my ears ', 'did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding  ', ' it is clear that mrs  toller knows more about this matter than anyone else  ', ' what could she mean by that note  mr  holmes ', 'there was the end of this tangled clue ', ' a juryman  did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured ', 'we can t command our love  but we can our actions ', 'just beyond it  however  at the far side of the kitchen door  a woman had stood and talked with a man  whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg ', ' no  he was averse to it also ', ' you villain  ', ' why  dash it all  ', 'i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me ', 'well  here s

scene of this investigation ', ' what do you read  ', 'now where did you get them from  ', 'he took off his coat and waistcoat  put on a large blue dressing gown  and then wandered about the room

very probable  ', ' and now there is only she to be described ', 'hers had been cut off  very possibly in some illness through which she has passed  and so  of course  yours had to be sacrificed also

jesting tone  but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me ', 'the embankment is not on the direct line to the station ', 'i told my pal what i had done  for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to ', ' it is for me to ask you that   he shrieked   you thieves ', 'who would have believed it ', 'you will ask me why i did not dispose of it ', 'his face flushed and darkened ', 'we must come back to that ', 'he brought up a card  too  with the name of  colonel lysander stark  engraved upon it ', ' had there been women in the house  i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue ', ' and yet i question  sir  whether  in all your experience  you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family  ',

these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer  but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of

is unfortunately more than possible  it is certain ', 'at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low  clear whistle  but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely ', ' then he might have called to you  ', ' certainly  ', 'he mumbled several words  you understand  but that was all that caught the son s ear ', 'from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years  that he was a widower  and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia ', ' yes  sir  for he had started to england just before it arrived  ', 'i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds  ', ' it was in january   85  that my poor father met his end  and two years and eight months have elapsed since then ', 'he asked ', 'so ', 'with hardly a word spoken  but with a kindly eye  he waved me to an armchair  threw across his case of cigars  and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner ', 'i simply wish to hear your real  real opinion  ', 'i was already deeply interested in his inquiry  for  though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded  still  the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own ', 'poor father has never been strong for years back  but this has broken him down completely ', 'then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure  a duty

' the cases which come to light in the papers are  as a rule  bald enough  and vulgar enough ', 'i dine at seven ', '  then we can hardly get there before midnight ', ' it is very kind of you  ', 'it was neville st  clair s coat  and not neville st  clair  which lay uncovered as the tide receded ', 'if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago  and has had no hat since  then

fleshless man ', 'but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over  for goodness  sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful  ', 'she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light  one hand upon the door  one half raised in her eagerness  her body slightly bent  her head and face protruded  with eager eyes and parted lips  a standing question ', 'if horner were in danger it would be another thing  but this fellow will not appear against him  and the case must collapse ', 'beyond these signs of his activity  however  which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press  i knew little of my former friend and companion ', 'the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training ', ' pray let us have it  for all that  ', 'there is a date  you see  but no superscription except leadenhall street  which is rather vague ', 'with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both good night and bustled off upon her way ', 'he asked ', ' they always fill me with a certain horror ',

results  you are unable to see how they are attained  ', ' what has she been saying to you  ', 'if i could only bring you down all would be well ', 'the station master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire ', 'i entered my consulting room and found a gentleman seated by the table ', '  undoubtedly so ', ' but what is it you wish  ', 'i thought that he was delirious ', 'he spoke in a slow staccato fashion  choosing his words with care  and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill usage at the hands of fortune ', ' well  i have only just heard the facts  but my mind is made up  ', ' there was a double line of tracks of a booted man  and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet ', 'this is my friend and colleague  dr  watson ', 'you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad  your son  who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do  should i ever chance to have one  ', 'a girl of fourteen  patience moran  who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate  was in one of the woods picking flowers ', 'she

at our disposal  and i was quickly between the sheets  for i was weary after my night of adventure ', 'that he should come to me for help  and that i should send him away to his death    ', ' a likely story ', ' the best possible  ', 'would she not have made an admirable queen ', ' thank you for this information   said he ', 'said holmes ', 'the other was his singular dying reference to a rat ', ' the coroner  i am afraid that i must press it ', ' we have at least an hour before us   he remarked   for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed ', ' and yet i am not convinced of it   i answered ', 'twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk  and yet mr  rucastle seemed to take no notice of it ', 'with a nod he vanished into the bedroom  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable  as of old ', ' well  really  when i consider that she has turned her back  i will not say upon me  but upon so much that many have aspired to without success  i can hardly explain it in any other fashion  ', ' mr  fowler was a very kind spoken  free handed gentleman   said mrs  toller serenely ', ' inspector bradstreet  sir  ', ' why shouldn t we be married right away  then   said he   and then i will feel sure of you  and i won t claim to be your husband until i come back  ', ' i thought as much   said he ', ' no  she was in her night dress ', 'the same post brought me a letter from westhouse   marbank  of fenchurch street  to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ   james windibank ', 'what was that  ', ' good heavens  ', 'there was an old chest of drawers in the room  the two upper ones empty and open  the lower one locked ', 'we know something of saxe coburg square ', 'but i would rather not talk about the creature  mr  holmes  and  indeed  he has little to do with my story  ', 'hence  you see  my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather  and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey ', 'asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye ', 'have you followed me so far  ', 'i ve had one or two little turns also with mr  john clay  and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession ', 'why should i attempt to conceal it  ', 'but if you have why  then  how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures ', ' there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn  near the museum  we are to be found in the museum itself during the day  you understand ', 'she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place ', 'let me know your train ', 'those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear ', 'a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose  looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered ', ' she walked into the breakfast room  ', ' and you are a benefactor of the race   said i   he shrugged his shoulders ', ' what will you do  then  ', 'you won t shake hands before i go  ', 'he looked her over in his searching fashion  and then composed himself  with his lids drooping and his finger tips together  to listen to her story ', ' it missed him  then  ', 'he would not go to the police  and he would not go to you  and so at last  as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done  it made me mad  and i just on with my things and came right away to you  ', 'he asked with his eyes open ', 'i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking  and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination ', ' but the gems  mr  holmes ', 'we got into a cab together  and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square  and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting ', ' ah  yes  of course ', 'it brings me twopence a sheet  and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day  ', 'there are several other indications  but these may be enough to aid us in our search  ', ' and the papers  ', 'his brows were drawn into two hard black lines  while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter ', 'and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting room behind me  and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand  as it seemed to me at the time  though the future only could show how strange it was to be ', 'it would be a sharp eyed coroner  indeed  who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work ', 'let s have it straight  now  ', 'we will talk about that ', ' i ve wasted time enough   said lestrade  rising ', 'i should not stay here ', 'sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together  his legs stretched out in front of him  and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling ', 'my wife is very anxious that you should come  for she has been much attracted by my description of you ', ' ah  watson   said holmes  smiling   perhaps you would not be very gracious either  if  after all the trouble of wooing and wedding  you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune ', 'the daughter was of a good  amiable disposition  but affectionate and warm hearted in her ways  so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages  and her little income  she would not be allowed to remain single long ', 'it appeared to you to be a simple

of the rat  then  ', ' texas  i think  ', 'i knew that none had fallen since the evening before  and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions ', 'he went alone  at his own request  for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult ', ' yes  and a most remarkable bird it proved ', 'this ring    he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand ', '  where could i find him  ', ' do you think that this man horner is innocent  ', ' which is it you want  then  ', 'may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast table so that you could see out of the window  ', 'i shouted  beside myself with rage ', 'a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner s jury ', ' well  some hundreds of times  ', 'which was a usual signal between my father and myself ', 'he shouted  struggling to break away from her ', 'i had the hint from holmes that this smooth faced pawnbroker s assistant was a formidable man  a man who might play a deep game ', ' really  now  ', ' the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other ', ' i was afraid that you were engaged  ', 'puzzle as i would  i could make nothing at all of what it meant ', ' by the way  would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from ', ' try the settee   said holmes  relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together  as was his custom when in judicial moods ', 'at three o clock precisely i was at baker street  but holmes had not yet returned ', 'this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement  how long had he been with you  ', ' i ll do better ', 'i dressed hurriedly  for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial  and hastened downstairs ', 'i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good night  ', ' they have but one retreat   whispered holmes ', ' you have a grand gift of silence  watson   said he ', ' give me your coat and umbrella   said holmes ', ' i was shaken but not hurt by the fall  so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run  for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet ', 'and now we must be silent and wait  ',

waved his hands  ', 'so perfect was the organisation of the society  and so systematic its methods  that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity  or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators ', 'one of the gold corners  with three of the beryls in it  was missing ', 'there is only one point on which i must insist ', 'however  in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow  so i bought a penny bottle of ink  and with a quill pen  and seven sheets of foolscap paper  i started off for pope s court ', '  come  man

 however  to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do  ', 'john swain cleared ', 'holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story ', ' you are all wrong  ',

out before the coroner and the police court  ', 'he is dark  handsome  and dashing  never calls less than once a day  and often twice ', 'i heard her voice downstairs  but i knew that she could not ascend ', 'how could she  a young and timid woman  make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him ', 'suddenly  to my surprise  the three at the altar faced round to me  and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me ', ' have you her photograph  ', ' i ve got him here   he whispered  jerking his thumb over his shoulder   he s all right  ', ' have you heard anything of the case  ', 'i see the direction in which all this points ', 'i slipped out of bed  all palpitating with fear  and peeped round the corner of my dressing room door ', 'i left him then  still puffing at his black clay pipe  with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland ', 'you should be ashamed of yourself  ', 'the blow was struck from immediately behind  and yet was upon the left side ',

came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall  which she closed and fastened as i approached ', 'yet when i think of him in cold blood  far away from the glamour of his

will be some 30 000 pounds  and for you  jones  it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands  ', ' the case has been an interesting one   remarked holmes when our visitors had left us

the door ', ' we have retained these things for some days   said holmes   because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address ', 'i tried to puzzle it out  but gave it up in

nothing of such men ', 'they will see that you are not there ', 'it was a few weeks before my own marriage  during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street  that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him ', ' we have had the pleasure of making the doctor s acquaintance   said holmes  and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred ', ' there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ', 'in life or in death  i am ever your loving   mary  ', ' and how did he make his money  ', 'oh ', 'there was nothing ', 'if the former  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping ', ' yes  it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so ', 'when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st  james s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down ', ' the man married a woman very much older than himself for her

find it very slow  but i shall only be away a couple of hours  ', ' what on earth can be the matter with him  ', 'remarked holmes ', 'well  there is nothing very instructive in all this ', 'his broad black hat  his baggy trousers  his white tie  his sympathetic smile  and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr  john hare alone could have equalled ', 'there it is  where the lady is walking  ', 'but i am inclined to think neither ', 'as to his dress  it was careful to the verge of foppishness  with high collar  black frock coat  white waistcoat  yellow gloves  patent leather shoes  and light coloured gaiters ', ' you may imagine  mr  holmes  that to me  destitute as i was  such an offer seemed almost too good to be true ', 'that is just my point ', ' there s a cold blooded scoundrel  ', 'i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again  where i was soon asleep ', ' imitated  ', 'i ran to her and threw my arms round her  but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground ', ' oh  my night could not be called monotonous   said he  and laughed ', ' always  ', 'it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from

note for me lay upon the hall table ', 'besides  what use was my hair to me ', 'no one is stirring yet  but i know where the stable boy sleeps  and we shall soon have the trap out  ', ' i thought i d bring him round myself  then he couldn t slip away ', 'are you sure that everything is fastened  ', 'this case  i presume  contains the coronet ', 'as well as i could learn  miss alice had rights of her own by will  but she was so quiet and patient  she was  that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr  rucastle s hands ', 'there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back  and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco prussian war ', '  no  no  we should have him loitering here always ', '  no  no  not the sole  not the sole

of disgraceful brawls took place  two of which ended in the police court  until at last he became the terror of the village  and the folks would fly at his approach  for he is a man of immense strength  and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger ', 'we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits  and yet the result is  it must be confessed  neither fascinating nor

clear to me   said holmes ', 'and this ', 'indeed  apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand  there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation  and his keen  incisive reasoning  which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work  and to follow the quick  subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries ', ' nearly eleven  ',

this affair  the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride  had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife  ', 'as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and  with a sudden effort  straightened it out again ', 'he looked from one to the other of us  as if uncertain which to address ', ' the fire looks very seasonable in this weather ', 'it s hard to say his

remarked  the initials  h ', ' quite so ', 'swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows  and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool ', 'he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best  with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed ', ' you hear ', 'it was an old rickety door and gave at once before

with you in five minutes  ', 'we have a seven mile drive before us  ', 'he appeared to be wrenching at it  or bending it with all his strength ', 'most of his time he would spend in his room  with the door locked upon the inside  but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand  screaming out that he was

impression upon me  and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect ', 'the  cooee  ', ' the ideal reasoner   he remarked   would  when he had once been shown a single fact in all

into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures ', ' besides  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr  lestrade ', 'it would only have made him mad to know  so we just fixed it all up for ourselves ', 'in a fit of anger  however  caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house  he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence ', 'they were on the upper floor  and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate  and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house ', 'he took up the paper in a listless way  but his attention instantly became riveted  and he gave a little cry of satisfaction ', 'he walked swiftly round from one to the other  pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane ', 'a camp bed  a small wooden shelf full of books  mostly of a technical character  an armchair beside the bed  a plain wooden chair against the wall  a round table  and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye ', '  thank god   he cried ', 'the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her ', 'said holmes  looking keenly at her ', 'but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression  ', ' one horse  ', 'the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within  and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window sill of the second floor ', 'this ground in front belongs to the house  but the woods all round are part of lord southerton s preserves ', 'i think that i recognise the symptoms ', 'as it was  he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man ', 'i wasn t best pleased  mr  holmes  when she married again so soon after father s death  and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself ', ' no  except that it was leadenhall street  ', 'when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation  where he remained for three or four years ', ' terse and to the point   remarked holmes  stretching his long  thin legs towards the fire ', 'it had only lain there a few days ', ' then  pray consult   said holmes  shutting his eyes once more ', ' well  would you please  sir  march upstairs  where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station  ', ' i have no doubt that i am very stupid  but i must confess that i am unable to follow you ', ' mrs ', 'i had not an idea who you were when you came in  ', 'as he spoke  the man  puffing and blowing  rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging ', 'that second window is the one that i jumped from  ', 'down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic  but at either side and on the heaped up edges of the foot paths it still lay as white as when it fell ', 'the bird gave a gulp  and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop ', ' not social  then  ', 'she had gone off with a man  and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband  the chances being in favour of the latter  ', 'we have had some skirmishes  but we had never set eyes upon each other before ', 'i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning  homeward bound to savannah ', 'i have not seen a paper for some days  ', ' so much so   i remarked   that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes  three have been entirely free of any legal crime  ', 'he asked ', 'having done that  we may drive back to our luncheon ', 'sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily ', 'there are not many in london which charge at that rate ', ' they will be here in a moment ', '  no  sir  i really could not   i answered firmly ', ' you ll never persuade me to believe that  ', ' no  i never heard of her using it ', 'my pence were duly paid  and the rest is familiar to you ', 'the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day ', ' you were travelling in the states  ', 'it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems ', ' there are one or two very singular points about this room ', 'neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle ', ' i went home to saxe coburg square  and i took the advice of my assistant ', ' i told you yesterday  and i repeat to day  that it was not  ', ' i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for  ', ' yes  to day  ', 'even though he knew that arthur had discovered him  he might still flatter himself that he was safe  for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family ', 'westaway was the name of the founder of the business  but it is really managed by miss stoper ', ' i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge ', ' he can t lie in the street ', 'you see we have already arrived  by a process of exclusion  at the idea that she might have seen an american ', 'then  as to sitting here or there  or amusing yourself in any manner indicated  that need cause you no inconvenience ', 'each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds  in case of marriage ', 'in dress now  for example ', '  pooh  ', 'there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way  and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver  ', ' your experience has been a most entertaining one   remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff ', ' your boy  arthur  went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts ', ' yes  ', 'but he could not help me in any way ', 'violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family  and in my stepfather s case it had  i believe  been intensified by his long residence in the tropics ', 'i shall take your advice in every particular  ', 'it cost me something in foolscap  and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings ', ' to an end  ', 'again holmes raved in the air ', ' mr  victor hatherley  hydraulic engineer  16a  victoria street  3rd floor   ', ' i had hoped   suggested holmes   that you would have joined us in a friendly supper  ', ' to eat it  ', '  that white one with the barred tail  right in the middle of the flock  ', 'he spoke calmly  but i could see that he was deeply moved ', 'on my way i saw william crowder  the game keeper  as he had stated in his evidence  but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father ', 'let us thrust this creature back into its den  and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened  ', ' i don t say that ', ' of course  we still have the feathers  legs  crop  and so on of your own bird  so if you wish     the man burst into a hearty laugh ', ' of what day  ', 'i cried ', 'said our new visitor  taking a step forward and shaking his hunting crop ', ' you have erred  perhaps   he observed  taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood   you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing  ', '  lord robert walsingham de vere st  simon  second son of the duke of balmoral  ', ' i am still in the dark  ', ' yes  there are nearly always some there  ', ' it is so ', 'here is the note written in pencil over here  ', 'screamed the old man furiously ', 'knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious  i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me  together with a hurried scrawl  telling her that she had no cause to fear  ', 'as evening drew in  the storm grew higher and louder  and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney ', 'spies and thieves ', 'i ll have the other  and i ll take it now   said i ', 'capital  ', ' it s more than a precious stone ', 'you cannot imagine how comical he was  and i laughed until i was quite weary ', 'but now  thanks to this lucky chance  i think that we have got them right enough  ', 'it was worth an effort to preserve it ', 'i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations  and in admiring the rapid deductions  as swift as intuitions  and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him ', 'and into her sitting room  which was the very room which i suspected ', 'your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me ', 'in a hundred other ways he has helped him ', ' who ever heard of such a mixed affair ', 'the furniture was scattered about in every direction  with dismantled shelves and open drawers  as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight ', ' surely this is not your husband s writing  madam  ', 'no reference to the matter at all  either in word or writing  ', 'i began to laugh at this  but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face ', ' it makes a considerable difference to me  having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely ', 'under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested  and a verdict of  wilful murder  having been returned at the inquest on tuesday  he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross  who have referred the case to the next assizes ', 'i suppose that i am commuting a felony  but it is just possible that i am saving a soul ', 'it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west ', 'ha  ha  my boy  what do you make of that  ', 'would you give me an introduction to him  ', ' all right   said holmes quietly ', 'he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb  but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes  sunk in the deepest thought ', 'where  ', 'just as i arrived the door was opened  and we were shown up together to holmes  room ', 'i hardly noticed his appearance ', 'but i ll have a sovereign on with you  just to teach you not to be obstinate  ', ' what ', '  very likely ', 'your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion  ', ' they often vanish before the ceremony  and occasionally during the honeymoon  but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this ', 'sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion  but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor ', ' as a rule   said holmes   the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be ', 'just read it out to me  ', 'the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand  and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come ', 'prima donna imperial opera of warsaw  yes ', 'i have a confused memory  too  of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere  ', ' i cannot tell  ', ' who was the criminal  then  ', 'so long was he that mr  holder and i went into the dining room and waited by the fire until he should return ', ' i feel it give a little   said he   but  though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers  it would take me all my time to break it ', ' then  what clue could you have as to his identity  ', 'then he became a little more reasonable ', 'there must be some strong reason behind  ', 'three thousand will cover the matter ', '  it is to keep people out who have no business there ', 'here s half a crown ', 'one would think they were the only geese in the world  to hear the fuss that is made over them  ', 'well  watson  we are  i fancy  nearing the end of our quest  and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs  oakshott to night  or whether we should reserve it for to morrow ', 'he d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young  he told me  and it had left him with a weak throat  and a hesitating  whispering fashion of speech ', 'one night  it was on the twentieth of march  1888  i was returning from a journey to a patient  for i had now returned to civil practice   when my way led me through baker street ', 'i thought that it must be when i saw the door open  ', '  and a very good thing  too  ', '  for how long  may i ask  do you want this sum  ', 'and your address had been given me ', 'it is her carriage ', 'you know my methods ', 'round this corner were three doors in a line  the first and third of which were open ', ' on the contrary  this is the right side  ', 'holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it  but without result ', ' yes  ', 'retired from operatic stage  ha ', ' my name   answered our visitor   is probably familiar to your ears ', 'we had  however  an aunt  my mother s maiden sister  miss honoria westphail  who lives near harrow  and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady s house ', 'so say the serpentine mews  to a man ', 'my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side  and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars  which were secured every night ', 'it was a chestnut  ', ' no  no   cried holmes  shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen ', ' oh  to the other side of the west end ', ' perhaps i have  ', 'i will explain the state of things to you  as far as i have been able to understand it  in a very few words ', 'could i not come at some more convenient hour  ', 'my wants were few and simple  so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise  rattling away to paddington station ', ' one tallow stain  or even two  might come by chance  but when i see no less than five  i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow  walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other ', ' yes  sir ', ' how could i help suspecting him  when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand  ', 'out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light  now bright  now faint  as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes ', ' then you may be so with me  ', 'she was passing the front pew at the time  and it fell over into the pew ', 'instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours  who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat  he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path ', 'for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen  but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks  and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser ', 'he had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem ', 'besides  we must be prompt  for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits ', ' yes ', 'the will is very clear upon that point ', ' oh  certainly  if it would give you any pleasure  ', 'a touch of red in nose and cheeks  with a slight tremor of his extended hand  recalled holmes  surmise as to his habits ', ' yes  ', 'written in pencil upon the fly leaf of a book  octavo size  no water mark ', 'a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place ', 'the passage outside was empty ', 'well  watson  we shall see who will win in the long run ', 'the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel ', ' the rest you will leave in our hands  ', 'holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness  such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced ', 'our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office  and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject  ', 'he had for years been known as a professional beggar  but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one ', ' it is dated from grosvenor mansions  written with a quill pen  and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger   remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle ', ' she was never happy at home  miss alice wasn t  from the time that her father married again ', ' my opinion is in no way altered  ', 'you know peterson  the commissionaire  ', 'the wind was howling outside  and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows ', 'and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again   here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage  and he glared down at me with the face of a demon   i ll throw you to the mastiff  ', ' two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances ', ' and now it is time that we arranged our little plans ', 'it was damp  marshy ground  as is all that district  and there were marks of many feet  both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side ', '  well   said i   you said you d give me one for christmas  and i was feeling which was the fattest  ', ' certainly  madam  ', ' is he quiet  ', ' well  there are some on the stall with the gas flare  ', 'my mistress told me that you were likely to call ', 'it swelled up louder and louder  a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek ', ' i warn you that they are very incomplete  ', 'he wore rather baggy grey shepherd s check trousers  a not over clean black frock coat  unbuttoned in the front  and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain  and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament ', ' and i to find an enemy  ', ' what could he have done single handed against a man in the prime of life  ', ' ah  but i was recommended to you  ', 'it was more a feeling of duty  a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place ', ' are you  indeed  now  ', 'there is nothing more to be said or to be done to night  so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men  ', ' the third on the right is his   said the inspector ', 'if so  how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself ', 'i glanced down at my hand  which was throbbing painfully  and then  for the first time  saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound ', ' they are coiners on a large scale  and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver  ', 'did i buy the geese off you  ', ' what do you mean  ', 'as he spoke the gleam of the side lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue ', 'we passed up the stair  unlocked the door  followed on down a passage  and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described ', 'i sent john  the coachman  to watch you  ran up stairs  got into my walking clothes  as i call them  and came down just as you departed ', ' holmes   i cried   i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at ', 'he followed me to my room  however  that night with a very grave face ', 'there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest  and which are worth considering  ', 'come  ', 'i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me  ', 'i asked ', 'it is in a german speaking country  in bohemia  not far from carlsbad ', 'the panel had closed again behind me  but the crash of the lamp  and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal  told me how narrow had been my escape ', 'she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham ', 'the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties  ', 'said holmes  sinking back in deep thought ', 'there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red  spongy surface where the thumb should have been ', 'every day  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon  i waited in my little den  until at last my heart began to sink  and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all ', 'i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them ', 'you have made two blunders in as many minutes ', 'had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me ', ' hullo ', 'his eyes sparkled  and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette ', ' farewell  then   said the old man solemnly ', ' only as much as we can deduce  ', ' what on earth does this mean  ', 'now  i knew that it was not you who had brought it down  so there only remained your niece and the maids ', 'holder   said he   i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money  ', ' my dear fellow  i congratulate you  ', ' if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three o clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you  ', 'it is evidently trying to your nerves  ', ' but what is that compared with the number of your successes  ', 'the inspector sat down at his desk ', 'but you may imagine what i felt when  just as i came to the altar rails  i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew ', ' never  ', 'what do you think of such a commission as that  ', 'when these hot fits were over  however  he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him  like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul ', 'mother said he was quite right to make me swear  and that it was a sign of his passion ', 'if you don t  it s a fine  law abiding country is england  and there s always a policeman within hail  ', ' only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles ', ' it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock  though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine  ', 'a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems  but no trace of them could be found  nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats ', ' he has his own little methods  which are  if he won t mind my saying so  just a little too theoretical and fantastic  but he has the makings of a detective in him ', ' i am sure that you are right  mr  holmes   cried our client ', ' thank you ', 'here is her carriage at the door  ', 'i had something else to think of  ', 'of course  that is only just for the time ', 'dr  roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran ', 'this dust  you will observe  is not the gritty  grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house  showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time  while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely  and could therefore  hardly be in the best of training  ', ' i signed the paper as directed  and the lawyer took it away with him ', 'it was a bitter night  so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats ', 'what are you going to do yourself  ', 'i used to be able to keep two assistants  but now i only keep one  and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business  ', 'finally he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug ', 'if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter  lord st  simon  i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful  ', ' you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins ', ' then what are they ', 'do you see  ', ' so i heard ', 'he was pacing the room swiftly  eagerly  with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him ', 'i think that i could be of assistance to you  ', 'and the flap has been gummed  if i am not very much in error  by a person who had been chewing tobacco ', 'there s two of us  me and my son  and you can have the keeping of us ', 'several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point  but he always glided away to some other topic  until at last i gave it over in despair ', 'it is a hereditary matter  so in order to give you an idea of the facts  i must go back to the commencement of the affair ', ' that is better   said john clay serenely ', ' my dear madam   said i   i am an old campaigner  and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed ', 'she would rush to secure it ', ' hold up  man  or you ll be into the fire ', 'his name is armitage  percy armitage  the second son of mr  armitage  of crane water  near reading ', 'the duke  his father  was at one time secretary for foreign affairs ', ' yes  there was a ring ', ' we have tried and failed  ', ' not at all ', 'the fat man cast his eyes round  and then up at the open skylight ', 'the fund was  of course  for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance ', ' i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried   said he ', 'and now  watson  this is too serious for dawdling  especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs  so if you are ready  we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo ', 'that is how he did it  ', 'the fire was burning brightly  and in the grate there was a mass of black  fluffy ashes  as of burned paper  while the brass box stood open and empty beside it ', 'i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table ', ' my god  ', 'he rummaged in his coat pocket  and  drawing out a piece of discoloured  blue tinted paper  he laid it out upon the table ', 'what do you mean  ', 'what was this nocturnal expedition  and why should i go armed ', 'there was no sign of any violence  and the water was but two feet deep  so that the jury  having regard to his known eccentricity  brought in a verdict of  suicide  ', 'at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other  while a number of better dressed people  who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it  crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man ', 'the banker s dressing room was a plainly furnished little chamber  with a grey carpet  a large bureau  and a long mirror ', 'the unusual salary  the curious conditions  the light duties  all pointed to something abnormal  though whether a fad or a plot  or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain  it was quite beyond my powers to determine ', 'one of the farms which he held  that of hatherley  was let to mr  charles mccarthy  who was also an ex australian ', 'jump  archie  jump  and i ll swing for it  ', 'we are at present  doctor  as no doubt you have divined  in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks ', ' yes  ', ' the london press has not had very full accounts ', 'by the time that their sailing ship reaches savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter  and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder  ', ' you reasoned it out beautifully   i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration ', ' oh  indeed  ', 'i cried ', ' but i have heard all that you have heard  ', ' you must confine yourself to your room  on pretence of a headache  when your stepfather comes back ', ' very likely not ', ' threatens to send them the photograph ', 'holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement ', '  certainly not ', ' before the what  ', ' that is the baboon  ', 'cried the inspector   you have formed your opinion ', 'said he ', 'from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor ', ' well  i thought over the matter all day  and by evening i was in low spirits again  for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud  though what its object might be i could not imagine ', 'there you are ', 'i asked as i entered ', ' sir  i cannot find words to thank you  but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done ', 'if there s police court business over this  you ll remember that i was the one that stood your friend  and that i was miss alice s friend too ', ' precisely  ', ' so they have ', ' as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved ', 'so much for the police court   said holmes thoughtfully  tossing aside the paper ', ' but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go ', 'but it was essential that they should use it soon  as it might be discovered  or the bullion might be removed ', 'it is of importance ', '  dearest do not be frightened ', 'he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention ', 'said holmes ', ' yes  he did  ', ' ah ', ' yes  that is it  ', 'he yelled ', 'he calls attention  and with reason  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him  also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father  and his singular account of his father s dying words ', 'i had been delayed at a case  and it was a little after half past six when i found myself in baker street once more ', ' in that case i shall continue my professional round ', ' so i have heard  ', 'what a week she must have spent  ', 'it is introspective  and i want to introspect ', 'that was a week ago  and from that time i have not sat again in the window  nor have i worn the blue dress  nor seen the man in the road  ', ' you will  however  i am sure  excuse me for taking an obvious precaution  ', 'for my part  i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it  ', 'if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress  presumably his overcoat  in his flight  and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off ', 'there was a moment s delay  but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again  and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall ', 'he shot a questioning glance at each of us  placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard  and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair ', 'have you your check book ', ' indeed  it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there ', 'at eleven o clock she rose to leave me  but she paused at the door and looked back ', 'what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article  ', 'but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady  ', 'it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man  who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game  like those out and out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship ', ' no  i had a dozen  ', ' thank you ', 'lord st  simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead ', ' why ', '  how far from the body  ', ' well  look at this  ', '  december 22nd ', ' i cannot imagine ', '  why   says he   here s another vacancy on the league of the red headed men ', ' i thought at first that you had done something clever  but i see that there was nothing in it  after all  ', 'she writhed as one who is in terrible pain  and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed ', 'so far i had got before i ever heard lord st  simon s narrative ', 'a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him ', ' the goose  mr  holmes ', ' a most painful matter to me  as you can most readily imagine  mr  holmes ', 'i went out  as if on some commission  and i made for my sister s house ', 'round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped  which was mottled all over with bloodstains ', 'it hadn t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it ', ' this is indeed important   said he ', ' i brought this with me  ', 'i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully ', 'wait in patience

could not live there longer without some advice ', 'smack ', 'we shall then look thoroughly into the affair ', ' i really have made no inquiries on the subject  ', 'here we are ', ' what  ', 'i cried

so ', 'i clambered out upon the sill  but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me ', 'my god  what shall i do ', ' he looked

reasons   i remarked   the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself  though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain

leaning back in his chair ', 'can you remember any other little things about mr  hosmer angel  ', 'in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one s self under obligations  ',

that we shall be able to strike deeper still ', 'it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all night sitting ', 'it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape  hard and much the worse for wear ', 'holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy faced  white aproned landlord ', 'she stood smiling  holding up a little slip of paper in the air ', 'the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the

trouble about my feelings ', 'cried the banker with a gesture of despair ', 'very right ', 'but you do not yourself look upon this as likely  ', 'the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half frightened  half hopeful eyes  as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe ', 'as to miss violet hunter  my friend holmes  rather to my disappointment  manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems  and she is now the head of a private school at walsall  where i believe that she has met with considerable success ', 'there was but one way for it ', '  tell me all about it   said i ', 'i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street ', 'what d you

shoulders ', '  is to copy out the  encyclopaedia britannica  ', 'he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view  talking all the time rather to himself than to us ', ' i have heard of you  mr  holmes ', 'and he said that i had nothing fit to wear  when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer ', 'i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket  and i thought that  as we were a partie carr e  you might have your rubber after all ', ' there is water in your eyes   said he as he released me ', 'simon  ', 'he picked a red covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece ', 'i found the ash of a cigar  which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar ', ' ah  you look on these things from another standpoint  ', 'now  if he had borrowed my money  or if he had married me and got my money settled on him  there might be some reason  but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine ', 'with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan  upon which he perched himself cross legged  with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him ', ' and so do i  it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day ', 'do you not see some loophole  some flaw ', 'you must also put in a note to say

credit in the capital and counties bank ', 'you have no further evidence  i suppose  than that which you have placed before us  no suggestive detail which might help us  ', 'yet when i spoke to her of the matter  she answered me abruptly  and in the carriage  on our way home  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause  ', 'adventure ii ', 'he was very willing to have a holiday  so we

the king of scandinavia  ', ' do you know him  ', ' not a word ', ' my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present  and i knew that she was always as good as her word ', 'there were sherlock holmes  the hydraulic engineer  inspector bradstreet  of scotland yard  a plain clothes man  and myself ', 'it was of the same peculiar tint  and the same thickness ', 'k  k    and then  put the papers on the sundial   ', 'the tip had been cut off  not bitten off  but the cut was not a clean one  so i deduced a blunt pen knife  ', ' that is it on the dressing table  ', 'it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles ', 'anyhow  he never got tallow stains from a gas jet ', 'i was glad that he should go  for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home ', '  you have called me names enough   said he   i will not stand it any longer ', 'think of the deeds of hellish cruelty  the hidden wickedness which may go on  year in  year out  in such places  and none the wiser ', 'the more featureless and commonplace a crime is  the more difficult it is to bring it home ', ' that is the letter which i have just received  mr  holmes  and my mind is made up that i will accept it ', 'one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool  and that the someone could not have been his son  for his son was away  and he did not know when he would return ', ' just see how it glints and sparkles ', ' certainly  sir   said baker  who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm ', 'there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child  or the thud of a drunkard s blow  does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours  and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going  and there is but a step between the crime and the dock ', 'i put my pistol to the head of the wagon driver  who was this very man mccarthy ', 'two years ago  having served my time  and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father s death  i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street ', ' no  ', 'but i cannot understand them  and i am not easy in my mind about them  ', 'it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller s art  and the thirty six stones were the finest that i have ever seen ', 'i think  perhaps  it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play  ', 'there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor  while the plaster was peeling off the walls  and the damp was breaking through in green  unhealthy blotches ', 'between a slop shop and a gin shop  approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave  i found the den of which i was in search ', 'i had just finished my tea when he returned  evidently in excellent spirits  swinging an old elastic sided boot in his hand ', ' it must stop here  however   said bradstreet ', 'in the case of pondicherry  seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment  in dundee it was only some three or four days ', 'look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining ', ' from east london ', ' i have been making a fool of myself   he gasped ', ' frequently  ', 'you made some small job in my lady s room  you and your confederate cusack  and you managed that he should be the man sent for ', ' ample  ', 'he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple minded nonconformist clergyman ', 'the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants  and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness ', 'when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club  and there  having charming manners  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits ', ' and very wet it seems to have made you   said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea jacket ', ' you are not very vulnerable from above   holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him ', 'had he lost his wife  ', ' yes  sir  i do  and i am ready enough to tell what i know  ', 'one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat  such as he had started to town in  he had on neither collar nor necktie ', 'i asked ', 'you are not averse to this trip  watson  ', ' no  no  the mystery  ', ' her father is very rich  ', 'said he   i ve let them go at six hundred for the three  ', 'filled with the most maddening doubts and fears  she rushed down the lane and  by rare good fortune  met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector  all on their way to their beat ', 'my dear young lady  ', 'this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him  ', 'oh  how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it ', ' you will find it rather disconnected  i fear  and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak ', ' for god s sake  have mercy  ', 'perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right  ', 'let me pass  i say  ', ' there is one thing   said john openshaw ', 'he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman ', ' well  watson   said holmes when our visitor had left us   what do you make of it all  ', ' i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room ', 'his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful  rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling ', 'he led us down a passage  opened a barred door  passed down a winding stair  and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side ', ' here  ', 'i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom ', 'i could even tell that they had been disturbed  for the woman had run back swiftly to the door  as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks  while wooden leg had waited a little  and then had gone away ', ' i owe you an apology   he said  raising his golden pince nez to his eyes ', 'i have no time ', ' i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope  and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine  ', 'a twitch brought away the tangled red hair  and there  sitting up in his bed  was a pale  sad faced  refined looking man  black haired and smooth skinned  rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment ', 'he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone ', 'but i want to find out about them  and who they are  and what their object was in playing this prank  if it was a prank  upon me ', 'we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative ', '  there are none missing ', 'he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper  and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred ', 'of these bedrooms the first is dr  roylott s  the second my sister s  and the third my own ', 'in the card case is a note ', ' i have no data yet ', 'then with a red head of hair  and an appropriate dress  i took my station in the business part of the city  ostensibly as a match seller but really as a beggar ', ' here is the foresight   said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat securer ', 'but between ourselves  windibank  it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me ', 'i didn t quite like that  mr  holmes ', ' your sister asked for it  i suppose  ', 'if not  why should you come to consult me  ', 'so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway  and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side ', ' i really don t know what to say ', 'pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door  ', '  death   said he  and rising from the table he retired to his room  leaving me palpitating with horror ', ' well  very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money ', ' last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream  and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure ', 'miss stoner did so  and holmes  after a careful examination through the open window  endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open  but without success ', 'pray step into the cab  and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know  ', 'the facts are these  about four o clock on christmas morning  peterson  who  as you know  is a very honest fellow  was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road ', 'that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it  and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years  although he has now fallen upon evil days ', 'she was plainly but neatly dressed  with a bright  quick face  freckled like a plover s egg  and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world ', 'just a trifle more  i fancy  watson ', 'i am sorry to have interrupted you ', ' it may turn out to be of more interest than you think ', 'there can be no doubt that the probability  the strong probability  is that the writer was on board of a ship ', ' i have my revolver   said i ', ' one day  it was in march  1883  a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel s plate ', ' i assured him that i was not offended ', 'it was a considerable sum  for people in their position  and the loss of it would have made a serious difference ', 'finally  i went to the landlord  who is an accountant living on the ground floor  and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red headed league ', 'he was a singular man  fierce and quick tempered  very foul mouthed when he was angry  and of a most retiring disposition ', 'that will be next monday  ', ' you see it  ', 'on the next occasion  in the midst of my laughter  i put my handkerchief up to my eyes  and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me ', 'he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman ', ' very good ', ' remember  watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain  we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years  penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence ', '  but   said i   there would be millions of red headed men who would apply  ', 'the stage lost a fine actor  even as science lost an acute reasoner  when he became a specialist in crime ', 'i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing room ', ' well  have you solved it  ', 'is that your hat  mr ', ' excellent ', 'his footmarks had pressed right through the snow  so long had he stood there ', 'it was all done in an instant  and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other  while the clergyman beamed on me in front ', 'it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots ', 'our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid  lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe ', ' he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope  ', ' that would be unnecessary ', 'it s the big white one over yonder ', ' thank you   said holmes   i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand  ', 'he came back alone  for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town ', ' it came here  ', 'both these witnesses depose that mr  mccarthy was walking alone ', ' indeed ', 'you do not mean bodies  ', 'yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me ', ' i am afraid  holmes  that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences ', ' this is where we shall find them  ', 'and  i say  peterson  just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me  for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring  ', ' how can you tell that  ', 'the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy backed one  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp ', ' i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now ', 'thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window ', ' indeed ', ' he doesn t look a credit to the bow street cells  does he  ', '  you shall leave it in the hands of the police  ', 'these  we presume  indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw ', 'sit down and let us talk it over  ', ' no  ', 'how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould  which told us a very plain tale ', 'that is the true story  gentlemen  of all that occurred  ', 'lestrade  being rather puzzled  has referred the case to me  and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home  ', 'you are to station yourself close to that open window  ', 'others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states  and were mostly concerned with politics  for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet bag politicians who had been sent down from the north ', ' then we have stopped all the holes ', 'some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier ', 'he rushed fiercely forward  and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness ', ' when you go out close the door  for there is a decided draught  ', 'and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar  a woman who is now in custody  and who had already made a disturbance at mr  doran s house that morning  ', 'toller lets him loose every night  and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon ', 'the question now was  who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet ', 'the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him  but he still refused to raise his eyes ', ' in answer to an advertisement  ', 'our visitor collapsed into a chair  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow ', 'but in avoiding the sensational  i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial  ', 'as he stepped up to the cab  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and

repeated  standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket chair ', 'i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter  and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here ', 'clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind ', 'i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred ', 'no doubt you will go to the prison to see james ', '  dear me ', 'it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives ', 'my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller ', 'do you not deduce something from that  ', 'which was it  ', 'a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time  and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer ', 'yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind  though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives ', '  pon my word  watson  you are coming along wonderfully ', ' i am afraid   said i   that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case  ', 'but i hear the rumble of wheels ', ' where to  ', 'beside the couch was a wooden chair  and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard

suspicion became a certainty ', 'and on the morning of the wedding  ', '  well  i hope to goodness the house won t be burgled during the night  ', 'my clothes were all sodden with dew  and my coat

not wish us to go ', ' yes  sir  but very quietly ', ' it was pitch dark inside the house  and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath ', ' well  perhaps  after

behind her landau when a cab came through the street ', 'holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down  but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery ', ' well  you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint

down upon me  slowly  jerkily  but  as none knew better than myself  with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp ', 'holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair  as was his habit when in high spirits ', 'he dashed her to one side  and  rushing to the window  cut at me with his heavy weapon ', 'he rushes to some secret hoard  where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary  and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat s sinking ', '  i shall certainly be there  ', ' no  but this horrible man confessed to having been there  and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs  ', 'i suppose that you have been watching the habits  and perhaps the house  of miss irene adler  ', 'muttered holmes  pulling at the rope ', 'then  ', ' i only looked in as i passed   said he ', ' i could hardly imagine a more damning case   i remarked ', 'it was a quiet  little  plainly furnished room  with a round table in the centre  on which several german books were scattered ', 'sherlock holmes was well known to the force  and the two constables at the door saluted him ', 'violence does  in truth  recoil upon the violent  and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another ', ' what s in here  ', 'her prolonged absence having caused some comment  her father followed her  but learned from her maid that

be caused if any harm were to befall it ', '  why  what is it  then  ', 'it is  as he said  beautifully situated  but it is not beautiful in itself  for it is a large square block of a house  whitewashed  but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather ', ' and now  mr  wilson  off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself  your household  and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes ', 'as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain  and the sound as of a large animal moving about ', 'there s plenty of thread  no doubt  but i can t get the end of it into my hand ', 'there was a movement and an exclamation from my right  and peering through the gloom  i saw whitney  pale  haggard  and unkempt  staring out at me ', ' my dear holmes  ', 'he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral tinted london street ', 'and no later than this morning ', 'close at his heels came the colonel himself  a man rather over the middle size  but of an exceeding thinness ', ' they would have had the lady s purse and watch if it hadn t been for him ', ' ballarat  ', 'boots which extended halfway up his calves  and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur  completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance ', 'i asked  smiling ', 'my own complete happiness  and the home centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment  were sufficient to absorb all my attention  while holmes  who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul  remained in our lodgings in baker street  buried among his old books  and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition  the drowsiness of the drug  and the fierce energy of his own keen nature ', 'he is a mr  godfrey norton  of the inner temple ', ' because he was handy and would come cheap  ', 'i heard a gentle sound of movement  and then all was silent once more  though the smell grew stronger ', ' they have  however  allowed me a policeman  who may remain in the house with me  ', 'your majesty  as i understand  became entangled with this young person  wrote her some compromising letters  and is now desirous of getting those letters back  ', 'i may be on the trail in this matter  or i may be following a will o  the wisp  but i shall soon know which it is ', 'have you a cab  ', 'the group of trees  with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun  were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door step ', 'however  it was too late to alter the matter now  so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work ', 'it was a small  office like room  with a huge ledger upon the table  and a telephone projecting from the wall ', 'on returning  he found that horner had disappeared  that the bureau had been forced open  and that the small morocco casket in which  as it afterwards transpired  the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel  was lying empty upon the dressing table ', 'i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply ', 'one is to a firm in the city  the other is to the young lady s stepfather  mr  windibank  asking him whether he could meet us here at six o clock tomorrow evening ', ' but if he is innocent  who has done it  ', 'the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson  so that he was left in possession of the field of battle  and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose  ', 'inspector bradstreet  b division  gave evidence as to the arrest of horner  who struggled frantically  and protested his innocence in the strongest terms ', 'i shall take no notice of such nonsense  ', ' well  let us hope so ', 'you saw her return by the kitchen door  i presume  ', 'a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner  a narrow white counterpaned bed in another  and a dressing table on the left hand side of the window ', 'it is this infernal st  simon marriage case ', ' and i you   holmes answered ', 'i have three maid servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion ', ' here is an advertisement which will interest you   said he ', '  i am afraid that that is quite impossible   said i  he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes  and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke ', 'you may set your mind at rest about that ', 'i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them  on promising him that there would be no prosecution ', 'asked holmes ', 'even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience ', 'my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence ', ' the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn ', 'we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to ', ' it s no use  john clay   said holmes blandly ', ' ha ', ' but they listened to my story with a smile ', 'i did not gain very much  however  by my inspection ', ' i promise   said holmes ', 'it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess  but as i have changed my clothes i can t imagine how you deduce it ', 'all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows  so that even here in the heart of great  hand made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation  like untamed beasts in a cage ', ' well  miss hunter  if your mind is made up  that settles the question   said holmes  smiling ', ' by the way   said i   you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there  and one of them has the shutters up  ', ' if you won t tell us the bet is off  that is all ', 'it was already dusk  and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge  waiting for the coming of its occupant ', ' yes  sir ', ' no  i shall be my own police ', ' will you go  ', ' yes  ', 'these little problems help me to do so  ', 'all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it  ', ' but you were on a friendly footing  ', 'in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side ', 'oh  it drives me half mad to think of it  and i can t sleep a wink at night  ', ' and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill  which interests me deeply  ', ' good heavens  ', 'it must be in her own house  ', 'of my mother ', 'depend upon it  there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace  ', 'there is that double possibility ', 'when he breathed his vows to her  as he had done to a hundred before her  she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart ', ' i tell you that it is friday  man ', ' certainly ', 'who were these german people  and what were they doing living in this strange  out of the way place ', 'its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape  a sprig of oak leaves in some parts  melon seeds or orange pips in others ', ' they have laid the supper  then   he said  rubbing his hands ', ' well  to tell the truth  i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp ', 'at least that was my first impression ', 'i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she  and that his marriage might have changed his whole life  but now  alas ', ' name the sum  and i will pay it  ', '  oh   says she   we ve set yours aside for you  jem s bird  we call it ', 'at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge  where a corner holding three gems had been torn away ', ' that is back through the house into saxe coburg square ', 'twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within ', 'and now  doctor  we ve done our work  so it s time we had some play ', 'then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand  he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words    the least sound would be fatal to our plans  ', ' i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk  mr  holmes   he said ', 'then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat ', 'that was always the way ', 'it corresponds with the injuries ', 'it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler ', 'i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes  and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents  as the jury stated  and were not to be connected with the warnings  ', ' yesterday  however  just as i was thinking of leaving the office  my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business ', 'he burst into convulsive sobbing  with his face buried in his hands ', ' yes   he continued  glancing out of the window ', ' have you managed it  ', ' and who is this captain calhoun  ', 'he had made a very considerable fortune in the states  and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes  and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them ', 'all day i was engaged in my professional work  and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street ', 'so he sat as i dropped off to sleep  and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up  and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment ', 'you must be weary  for you have had a long day  ', ' from hatherley farm house to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile  and two people saw him as he passed over this ground ', 'early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading  but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared  and even holmes  ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts ', 'he is the green grocer who brings our vegetables round ', 'i ask you now  is such a theory tenable  ', 'we called at the door  when the maid  at holmes  request  showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death  and also a pair of the son s  though not the pair which he had then had ', 'there have been two murders  a vitriol throwing  a suicide  and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty grain weight of crystallised charcoal ', 'as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord  explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance  and that it was possible that we might spend the night there ', ' his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride ', 'then they will not lose a minute  for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape ', 'it is not too much to say that once or twice  as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure  he has been more nearly correct than the official force  ', 'he opened the case  and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table ', ' and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side ', 'and you have no doubt that it is your husband s hand  madam  ', 'the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat ', ' no  ', 'i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative  but  on the contrary  he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention ', 'was it not extraordinary ', 'lestrade looked sadly at my companion ', 'i sprang up and lit the lamp  but nothing was to be seen in the room ', 'who is this k  k  k   and why does he pursue this unhappy family  ', ' but you have hopes  ', 'carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death  i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder ', 'bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre ', 'i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear  and the sight sent a chill to my own heart ', 'she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room ', 'asked holmes ', 'one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled  but had refused to credit that it was his mistress  believing her to be with the company ', ' colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door  which he unlocked ', 'i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used  ', 'she cried  throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade ', 'i saw where boots had faced round  where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle  and  finally  where a few drops of blood had fallen  to show me that i was not mistaken ', ' the coroner  how was it  then  that he uttered it before he saw you  and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol ', 'but the maiden herself was most instructive  ', ' god bless you ', ' eh ', 'i waited until midnight  but there was no sign of his return  so i retired to my room ', 'what can i do  ', 'for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things  so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information ', ' this is a very unexpected turn of affairs   said i   and what then  ', ' well  really  i came to seek a theory  not to propound one ', ' no  no  there s life in him  ', 'he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight  but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird ', '  if i promise to keep a secret   said i   you may absolutely depend upon my doing so  ', 'there has been an enclosure here  ', 'holmes refused to examine the third chamber  so we passed at once to the second  that in which miss stoner was now sleeping  and in which her sister had met with her fate ', '  that will do   said he   i could not ask for anything better ', 'asked holmes ', 'i had let myself go  and was hanging by the hands to the sill  when his blow fell ', 'his brain is as cunning as his fingers  and though we meet signs of him at every turn  we never know where to find the man himself ', 'you see  mr  holmes  i am a very stay at home man  and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it  i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat ', 'such are the true facts of the death of dr  grimesby roylott  of stoke moran ', ' indeed ', 'two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount  but i can only touch the interest  ', 'together we rushed into the room ', 'left his lodgings at ten o clock at night  and has not been heard of since ', 'he said that he had never heard of any such body ', ' this aroused my curiosity  so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge  i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house ', ' now  if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure  ', ' i think  miss hunter  that we had better go in without you ', 'he s a remarkable man  is young john clay ', 'and why could he not write ', 'lord st  simon glanced over it ', 'i cannot tell ', ' still  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters ', 'i asked ', 'i paid the man and hurried into the church ', ' you may rely upon my doing all that i can  ', ' look here  watson   he said when the cloth was cleared  just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little ', ' well  it is a possible supposition  ', ' a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect   remarked holmes ', ' this is the dundas separation case  and  as it happens  i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it ', 'she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row  ', ' he has written to me to say that he would be here at six ', ' you must know that my grandfather had two sons  my uncle elias and my father joseph ', 'but we have to be careful  for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint ', ' how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments  ', 'not more than is usual in my family  ', 'the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver  but holmes  hunting crop came down on the man s wrist  and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor ', ' yes  when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in ', 'getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter  after all ', ' but what is the good of all these vague theories   cried the banker impatiently   when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands  ', 'there were  it is true  some blood stains upon his right shirt sleeve  but he pointed to his ring finger  which had been cut near the nail  and explained that the bleeding came from there  adding that he had been to the window not long before  and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source ', ' in this sinister way i came into my inheritance ', ' they have been turning out half crowns by the thousand ', 'and this promises to be interesting ', 'sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down ', ' it was clamped to the floor ', ' no  ', ' but he is right ', 'for that matter  reading  and possibly other large towns  were within that radius  so the place might not be so secluded  after all ', 'he did tell me the address ', '  yes  our little place is quite out in the country ', 'now for the  eg  ', 'his signet ring  ', ' precisely so ', ' and what then  ', ' the gentleman i describe  ', ' you did not overhear what they said  ', ' i suppose you know all about it   he snarled ', ' not i  ', 'again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland ', 'the distinction is clear ', 'i cannot tell where it came from  perhaps from the next room  perhaps from the lawn ', 'by a curious chance you came upon her tresses ', 'could i not snap the bond ', ' i am following you closely   i answered ', 'he was trying to utter the name of his murderer ', 'what can this be  ', 'it was from her that i had your address ', ' it is very essential  miss stoner   said he   that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect  ', 'this fellow  a lascar  was well paid by me for his rooms  so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession ', 'it was not very long before my friend s prediction was fulfilled ', 'and now let us hear a true account of the next act ', ' then let us do so ', 'from north  south  east  and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement ', 'you have been brought there to personate someone  and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber ', 'is the security sufficient  ', 'the latter is always instructive ', ' the name  you see  is in perfectly black ink  which has dried itself ', 'it was a labyrinth of an old house  with corridors  passages  narrow

had nothing since breakfast  ', 'has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window  ', ' if his motives were innocent  why does he not explain them  ', 'it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to morrow  only that this good gentleman  mr  holmes  came round to us this evening  though how he found us is more than i can think  and he showed us very clearly and kindly

shoulders ', ' i took the lamp from him  and i examined the machine very thoroughly ', 'i love and am loved by a better man than he ', 'are you satisfied  ', ' you saw the ventilator  too  ', ' it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business  but he was not of a business turn ', 'holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady  but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground  with the blood running freely down his face ', ' look there  ', 'it was no wonder that no one was stirring ', 'a blow was struck  and in an instant the lady  who had stepped from her carriage  was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men  who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks ', 'he was always well dressed  very neat and plain  but

behind me ', ' who knows ', ' i guessed as much  ', ' oh  yes  i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went  but i was kind of rattled  and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn t know what i was doing or saying ', 'i was already a dying and a desperate man ', 'in that case  miss stoper  i had best inspect a few more of your young

swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us ', ' no legal papers or certificates  ', ' pooh  pooh ', 'seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable  i left him and returned towards hatherley farm ', 'a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height  with the chest and limbs of a hercules ', ' indeed  doctor   said holmes blandly ', 'there was only one thing in it  but i am sure that you would never guess what it was ', 'a thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun coloured houses  and the opposing windows loomed like dark  shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths ', ' thank you   said my patient   but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me  and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure ', ' this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter ', ' no  a client ', 'but you will find that all i say is really to the point ', 'he had turned his back so that none could see him but i  his form had filled out  his wrinkles were gone  the dull eyes had regained their fire  and there  sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise  was none other than sherlock holmes ', ' but his lameness  ',

those of a frightened horse  into the gloom behind her ', ' what ', 'i can make neither head nor tail of the business  ', ' pray do so  ', 'i read suspicion there and annoyance  but no jest ', ' i will do so  and i will show you the steps by which i reached it ', 'i have myself some small business matters to attend to ', 'running up  i blew its brains out  and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck ', 'with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks  ', 'his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin  and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones ', 'he had always laughed at what he called my cock and bull story about the colonel  but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself ', '31 lyon place  camberwell  ', ' you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet  ', 'holmes turned to his desk and  unlocking it  drew out a small case book  which he consulted ', ' better close the front door   cried holmes  and we all rushed down the stairs together ', ' well  your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next ', ' won t it ring  ', 'in each case  not only are the  e s  slurred and the  r s  tailless  but you will observe  if you care to use my magnifying lens  that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well  ', 'i had  as you know  cut off my hair in london  and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk ', 'i will tell you  however ', ' some cold beef and a glass of beer   he answered  ringing the bell ', 'said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room ', 'she would like advice  but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication ', 'kill it and take it with you  ', 'so now  ', 'and the rucastles go out to night  ', 'were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand  all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream ', 'and then suddenly the whole business came to an end  ', 'as i strolled up and down  glancing at them occasionally  mr  rucastle came out to me  looking as merry and jovial as ever ', ' at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station ', 'i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs  ', ' then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot  ', 'it is true that  for mrs  henry baker  was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird s left leg  and it is also true that the initials  h ', 'sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle ', ' i had an idea that he might  and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me  ', 'and the man who wrote the note is a german ', ' it s nothing of the kind  ', 'and when he speaks of irene adler  or when he refers to her photograph  it is always under the honourable title of the woman ', ' here it is ', ' i have some remembrance   said he   that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small  unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour ', 'when a woman thinks that her house is on fire  her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most ', 'now  then ', 'but here are three separate tracks of the same feet  ', ' quite an interesting study  that maiden   he observed ', ' you can see him very well  ', 'in fact  in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect  who  it seems  made his home there ', '  what  the red headed man  ', 'that was the word the man uttered  and of which his son only caught the last two syllables ', ' i think  watson   he remarked at last   that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this  ', 'i could see a change in my uncle  however ', 'it only remains  therefore  to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face ', 'he made a slight motion to me to approach him  and instantly  as he turned his face half round to the company once more  subsided into a doddering  loose lipped senility ', 'his appearance  you see  is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him ', 'and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes ', 'he asked ', 'she cried  glancing from one to the other of us  and finally  with a woman s quick intuition  fastening upon my companion   i am so glad that you have come ', 'holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house  with toller hurrying behind us ', 'he was a remarkably handsome man  dark  aquiline  and moustached  evidently the man of whom i had heard ', ' he knows it already ', '  as governess  ', ' we have got to the deductions and the inferences   said lestrade  winking at me ', 'as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not  but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to ', 'briefly  watson  i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry  and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots  as i have done before now ', 'then i  rather imprudently  wished you good night  and started for the temple to see my husband ', 'get out  ', 'i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george s house  managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet  learned that his master had cut his head the night before  and  finally  at the expense of six shillings  made all sure by buying a pair of his cast off shoes ', 'on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner  he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it  and that it was no more than his deserts ', ' and how  ', ' yes  i think we had better do as you suggest  ', ' but you can understand   said our strange visitor  sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead   you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person ', 'i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women ', 'nothing had been said during our drive  but the high  thin breathing of our new companion  and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands  spoke of the nervous tension within him ', ' you are the first who have ever heard my story ', 'after an hour or so  mr  rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day  and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery ', ' the game s up  ryder   said holmes quietly ', 'it could not be delirium ', ' and why  ', 'within there was a small corridor  which ended in a very massive iron gate ', 'i ve had enough of it ', 'in a word  i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past ', 'i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results ', ' but have you   i asked   formed any definite conception as to what these perils are  ', 'the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table ', 'i only doubt       the propriety of my leaving it ', 'i panted ', 'a little over precipitance may ruin all  ', 'sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture  however  for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door ', 'i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it ', 'i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast ', 'viii ', 'i cried half mad with grief and rage ', ' well  yes  of course the pay is good  too good ', ' never better ', 'we shall now have a little supper and then retire  for we may have a very busy day to morrow  ', ' not at all   said i   i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes ', 'she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered  and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street ', ' witness  he mumbled a few words  but i could only catch some allusion to a rat ', ' you speak of danger ', 'he was removed  loudly protesting  to the police station  while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue ', 'i would call your attention very particularly to two points ', ' here is the slip and here are four letters from him  ', 'good day  mr  holmes  and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first  ', 'was dressed in   etc   etc ', 'it was close upon four before the door opened  and a drunken looking groom  ill kempt and side whiskered  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes  walked into the room ', ' no  his friend ', ' i suppose   said holmes   that when mr  windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball  ', 'he asked ', ' it is a question of cubic capacity   said he   a man with so large a brain must have something in it  ', 'holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client ', 'he was plainly but neatly dressed  and his age  i should judge  would be nearer forty than thirty ', 'now we can talk in safety  ', 'he cried ', 'she came to mr  doran s door just after we returned  and she endeavoured to push her way in  uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife  and even threatening her  but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort  and i had two police fellows there in private clothes  who soon pushed her out again ', ' he is asleep   said he ', 'then  with a gesture of desperation  he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground ', ' my private note paper  ', 'holmes drove in silence  with his head sunk upon his breast  and the air of a man who is lost in thought  while i sat beside him  curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely  and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts ', ' no  i do not think so ', 'he was wild  wayward  and  to speak the truth  i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money ', 'pray take the basket chair ', 'it is well thought of  ', ' i am sure we owe you an apology  mrs  toller   said holmes   for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us ', 'but i  who knew how he winced from the very thought of death  had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it ', '  tell me  dad   said she  looking  i thought  a little disturbed   did you give lucy  the maid  leave to go out to night  ', 'i am sorry to hear you say that ', ' who is on duty  ', 'two hansoms were standing at the door  and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above ', 'i should become the laughing stock of scotland yard  ', 'let me out  ', ' and i have some business to do which will take some hours ', ' yes  have you not heard ', ' were there gipsies in the plantation at the time  ', 'there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage  but otherwise everything was deadly still ', 'he was too good and kind to leave me so ', 'there is the first volume of it in that press ', 'a flush stole over miss sutherland s face  and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket ', ' the letter arrived on march 10  1883  his death was seven weeks later  upon the night of may 2nd  ', 'whose  then  ', ' i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner ', ' most certainly it does ', ' yes  that is the crown  ', 'in the latter  as may be remembered  sherlock holmes was able  by winding up the dead man s watch  to prove that it had been wound up two hours before  and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time  a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case ', ' here is a very fashionable epistle   i remarked as he entered ', ' yes  ', 'but there is a ring at the bell  watson  and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four  i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client ', 'he threw over a sheet of thick  pink tinted note paper which had been lying open upon the table ', ' you horrify me  ', ' i cannot imagine  ', 'these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat ', '  yes  we could easily give you a shake down  ', 'there was a long silence  broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes  finger tips upon the edge of the table ', 'you say so ', '  then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it  ', 'this fellow is madly  insanely  in love with her  but some two years ago  when he was only a lad  and before he really knew her  for she had been away five years at a boarding school  what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office ', 'as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil  i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door ', 'he asked in a quavering voice ', 'what a queen she would have made  ', 'i think that i have seen enough now  miss stoner  and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn  ', ' it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible  whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth ', 'i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes  ', 'let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter  and the date of his supposed suicide  ', ' are they not fresh and beautiful  ', ' grave enough  ', ' why  indeed  ', 'perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook ', 'the bride gave me a sovereign  and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion  ', '  oh  any old key will fit that bureau ', 'and  who did you sell the geese to  ', 'it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband s trouble  to me as a doctor  to my wife as an old friend and school companion ', '  thank you  maggie   says i   but if it is all the same to you  i d rather have that one i was handling just now  ', 'who would have ever believed it  ', 'then with his lens he tested the hinges  but they were of solid iron  built firmly into the massive masonry ', 'there is no other   said i   but the papers must be those that are destroyed  ', ' yes  ', ' to the police  ', 'that is quite settled   said he  rising and putting his lens in his pocket ', 'it was twenty five minutes past four ', 'sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this ', 'as to holmes  i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end  with knitted brows and an abstracted air  but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it ', 'in victoria ', 'i hadn t been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road ', ' this concluded the examination of the witness  ', ' no  no ', ' warm ', 'the centre door was closed  and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed  padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall  and fastened at the other with stout cord ', 'it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes  requests  for they were always so exceedingly definite  and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery ', 'whispered holmes ', 'he denied strenuously having ever seen mr  neville st  clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police ', ' and where is it  ', '  yes  sir  ', 'ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine  ', 'i followed them up and found they led to the hall window  where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting ', 'inspector bradstreet would  i am sure  make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities ', 'where are they  ', 'as i expected  his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects ', ' now  mr  sherlock holmes   said the lady as we entered a well lit dining room  upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out   i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions  to which i beg that you will give a plain answer  ', ' pray make no apology to me   said lord st  simon bitterly ', 'and then i think that what he foresaw happened  ', ' the warning was no idle one  for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o clock in the morning ', ' good heavens  ', '  what are you doing there  ', 'james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel ', 'from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages  it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation  ', ' you think so  too  ', 'while she was walking in this way down swandam lane  she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry  and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and  as it seemed to her  beckoning to her from a second floor window ', 'with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way ', 'draw up a little to the fire  and we will talk this matter over  ', ' there s the village   said the driver  pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left   but if you want to get to the house  you ll find it shorter to get over this stile  and so by the foot path over the fields ', ' very much so  ', 'there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men ', ' i was amused by her society  and she could see that i was amused  ', 'the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown  worm eaten oak  so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house ', 'i took the paper from him and read as follows    to the red headed league  on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins  of lebanon  pennsylvania  u  s  a   there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services ', 'and underneath  ', ' i wired to bristol for it last night  ', 'i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement ', 'you bring mrs  oakshott here and i ll answer her  but what have you to do with it ', 'let us glance at our continental gazetteer  ', ' she will not sell  ', ' nous verrons   answered holmes calmly ', 'i am the last court of appeal  ', ' p   of course  stands for  papier  ', 'he asked ', 'it was twenty five minutes to twelve  and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind ', 'october 9  1890   sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it  until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter ', 'now  i know that there are seventeen steps  because i have both seen and observed ', 'it is  of course  a trifle  but there is nothing so important as trifles ', 'by the way  in view of recent occurrences  perhaps i ought to ask mrs  hudson to examine its crop  ', 'he sat at my side in silence all the time  and i was aware  more than once when i glanced in his direction  that he was looking at me with great intensity ', 'finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall ', 'we heard the door open  a few hurried words  and then quick steps upon the linoleum ', ' quite so ', '  oh  merely a couple of hundred a year  but the work is slight  and it need not interfere very much with one s other occupations  ', ' but have you told me all  ', 'in the surgeon s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon ', ' you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct  and if she died from some sudden fright  ', 'it lay between that and her bedroom  and i was determined to see which ', ' my name is john robinson   he answered with a sidelong glance ', ' oh  yes ', ' when i arrived at the house   continued holmes   i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me ', 'what will he say when he returns  ', 'you seem to have done the thing very completely ', ' it is very good of lord st  simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own   said sherlock holmes  laughing ', ' there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work   he remarked   so i think  watson  that i must leave you to your papers for a little  ', 'his manner was brisk  and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age  for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked ', ' you are hungry   i remarked ', ' did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was ', ' let you have five hundred to morrow morning  ', 'both mr  and mrs  rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it  which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence ', 'three of our boys were killed  however  before we got the swag ', 'he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart ', 'but i ll go home with you ', '  mr ', ' it was a confession   i ejaculated ', 'said he  looking at me keenly ', 'it is a hat of the very best quality ', ' after all  watson   said holmes  reaching up his hand for his clay pipe   i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies ', ' but we can t all be  ', ' i am so delighted that you have come   she said earnestly ', 'there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force  and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you ', 'it would be a pity to miss it  ', ' a call for help  you thought  ', 'he started me off upon the letter a  and then he left me  but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me ', 'if you but make such reparation as is in your power  by telling us where the beryls are  all shall be forgiven and forgotten  ', 'he was himself red headed  and he had a great sympathy for all red headed men  so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees  with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour ', ' and is that all  ', ' and when i raise my hand  so  you will throw into the room what i give you to throw  and will  at the same time  raise the cry of fire ', 'and holmes  fears came to be realised  for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman  the sinister german  or the morose englishman ', 'but there is  if you will excuse my saying so  something just a little funny about it ', ' well  to come to an end of the matter  mr  holmes  and not to abuse your patience  there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back ', 'there is a distinct element of danger  ', ' whose house is it  ', 'they were all engaged for the evening  ', 'then he struck gold  invested it  and came up by leaps and bounds  ', 'in an instant his strange headgear began to move  and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent ', ' very good  lestrade   said holmes  laughing ', ' no  your secret lies in london ', ' the gas was half up  as i had left it  and my unhappy boy  dressed only in his shirt and trousers  was standing beside the light  holding the coronet in his hands ', 'i fainted when it was done  and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time ', '  that s all right   said he  coming back ', ' there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action ', 'it becomes a personal matter with me now  and  if god sends me health  i shall set my hand upon this gang ', 'therefore he used a holder ', 'he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said    good night  mister sherlock holmes  ', ' no  that was not the point ', ' i am delighted to hear it   he said ', ' i knew your energetic nature  and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime  ', ' thank you ', 'he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion ', ' witness  it was ', 'even his voice was gentle ', 'at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal  beside which on a three legged wooden stool there sat a tall  thin old man  with his jaw resting upon his two fists  and his elbows upon his knees  staring into the fire ', ' but what other is there  ', ' at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance  ', ' she told me to ask you  ', 'it is the precious stone  ', '  well  perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment ', 'he lay back without wincing  though he bit his lip from time to time ', 'asked holmes  yawning ', 'her jacket was black  with black beads sewn upon it  and a fringe of little black jet ornaments ', 'by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade  as to the personality of the criminal  ', ' now  what is your own impression as to the young lady s  your wife s character  ', ' data ', 'he was a devil incarnate ', 'it may  however  have been written on monday and only posted to day  ', ' i was not and am not sure which  but i knew that the ship must have an american origin  ', 'said she ', 'said holmes severely ', 'said he ', ' here he is   said he  sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee ', 'i slipped out  put on my things  and followed him ', 'she cried   he has followed me  then  ', 'you know what woman s instincts are ', ' i shall not keep you waiting an instant   said he  and vanished into the darkness ', 'he chuckled to himself as he spoke  his eyes twinkled  and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night ', 'we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds ', ' it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business  ', 'oh  if you do  mr  holmes  do tell him that i know him to be innocent  ', 'hosmer  mr  angel  was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street  and      what office  ', '2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots ', ' i then lounged down the street and found  as i expected  that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden ', '  and he is admirably suited for it   the other answered ', ' it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries ', 'we laid him upon the drawing room sofa  and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife  i did what i could to relieve his pain ', 'when i cried out that it was a false alarm  she replaced it  glanced at the rocket  rushed from the room  and i have not seen her since ', ' in the bathroom   he answered ', 'the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked ', 'then  when he had left  you rifled the jewel case  raised the alarm  and had this unfortunate man arrested ', 'i didn t know what to do ', '  so   said he  smiling   it was you  then ', 'i have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds ', ' yes  but only for you and me  ', 'then at the gasfitters  ball you met  as i understand  a gentleman called mr  hosmer angel  ', ' he ', 'but how on earth      oh  tut  tut ', 'it was indeed a gigantic one  and capable of exercising enormous pressure ', 'what did you do  then ', ' i could do with much less than that  mr  holmes  but you understand that as long as i live at home i don t wish to be a burden to them  and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them ', ' save  perhaps  the sign of four  ', 'he has not been home for two days ', ' now  then  what s the last entry  ', ' and the murderer  ', ' thank you  ', 'my heart turned to water  for there was no sign of the stone  and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred ', ' i would give my fortune to have them back  ', ' nothing  ', 'yours faithfully  st ', 'it had ceased ere i was wide awake  but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere ', 'now  mr  jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning  and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time ', ' my dear fellow  there lies the problem ', 'i am but thirty now  ', 'here we may take it that there is a love matter  but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed  or grieved ', 'i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross ', 'don t wait up for me in case i should be late  ', ' you will leave that question in my hands ', 'of these  one  the  lone star   instantly attracted my attention  since  although it was reported as having cleared from london  the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union  ', 'his grandfather was a royal duke  and he himself has been to eton and oxford ', 'oh  do not waste the so precious time  but come  ', ' yes  my stepfather ', ' now  my dear sir   said holmes   is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think ', 'frank had been a prisoner among the apaches  had escaped  came on to  frisco  found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england  followed me there  and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding  ', 'here is the stone  the stone came from the goose  and the goose came from mr  henry baker  the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you ', 'how could you know anything of the matter  ', ' your presence might be invaluable  ', 'gasped hatherley ', ' now we shall go upstairs   said he at last ', 'did i not tell you  ', '  no  i cannot  ', 'it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open  ', 'the man sat huddled up in his chair  with his head sunk upon his breast  like one who is utterly crushed ', 'you are screening your stepfather  ', 'i answered ', ' i think that this typewritten letter is from you  in which you made an appointment with me for six o clock  ', '  that is quite correct   i answered   but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications ', 'there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments  and there were no other traces of mr  neville st  clair ', ' none  ', 'the point about the signature is very suggestive  in fact  we may call it conclusive  ', 'sir  i can stand this strain no longer  i shall go mad if it continues ', '

my request  made a careful examination of the attic  which had been always locked up ', 'in the last century  however  four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition  and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency ', 'i found my father expiring upon the ground  with his head terribly injured ', 'good night  ', ' oh  no  not now ', 'oh  heaven bless you  ', 'he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled ', ' the doctor  ', 'he ', 'i asked ', 'it was after five o clock when sherlock holmes left me  but i had no time to be lonely  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner s man with a very large flat box ', ' not him  ', 'i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort  sir  though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society  ', 'too little  if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury  too much  if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr  as a dying reference to a rat  and the incident of the vanishing cloth ', 'in the pocket is a card case ', 'a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle ', ' no good news  ', 'i laid the two tresses together  and i assure you that they were identical ', 'it grew worse as alice grew up  for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police ', ' yes  it would be as well  ', 'i already feel it closing in upon me ', 'cried the banker with an ashen face ', ' and now i have a very strange experience to tell you ', ' holmes  the scotland yard jack in office  ', ' some years ago  to be definite  in may  1884  there came to lee a gentleman  neville st  clair by name  who appeared to have plenty of money ', ' precisely so  on december 22nd  just five days ago ', ' that is not always so easy  ', 'the story has  i believe  been told more than once in the newspapers  but  like all such narratives  its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes  and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth ', 'i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two ', 'i wish to the lord that i had shot him then  but i spared him  though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face  as though to remember every feature ', ' very likely not ', ' still  if i had married lord st  simon  of course i d have done my duty by him ', ' i really wouldn t miss your case for the world ', ' it s quite too funny ', 'what an exposure ', 'my wife was on a visit to her mother s  and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street ', 'oh  he will be silent  ', ' beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour  that he takes snuff  that he is a freemason  that he has been in china  and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately  i can deduce nothing else  ', 'if my hair would only change colour  here s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into  ', 'i have known something of him before  ', ' it is nothing very formidable   he said  taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket ', 'she cried   i do so want a little help  ', 'hunter  ', ' on june 3rd  that is  on monday last  mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool  which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley ', ' really ', 'asked holmes ', 'there is no reason  therefore  to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind ', ' but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room ', ' it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one  mr  hatherley   said he ', ' so it appears  ', 'no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted ', 'on the inside of the flap he wrote  s  h  for j ', 'the method was no doubt suggested to clay s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice s hair ', 'he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard  sandwiched it between two rounds of bread  and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition ', 'he opened the yellow envelope  and then  glancing at the message  threw it across to me ', 'she could trust her own guardianship  but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man ', 'i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london  ', 'there are windows in it  of course  ', ' will you bet  then  ', 'as it pulled up  one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper  but was elbowed away by another loafer  who had rushed up with the same intention ', ' why serious  ', 'by the way  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall  ', ' on entering the house  however  i examined  as you remember  the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens  and i could at once see that someone had passed out ', 'the lens discloses a large number of hair ends  clean cut by the scissors of the barber ', 'turner had a considerable household  some half dozen at the least ', 'naturally  it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value  but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this ', 'frank said that he would go and make his pile  too  and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa  so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived ', 'come ', 'i distinctly saw his bare throat  ', 'i rushed down the passage  through the door  and straight into the arms of mr  rucastle  who was waiting outside ', 'petrified with astonishment  the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair ', 'he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes  as though his question was already answered ', ' there is a train at half past nine   said i  glancing over my bradshaw ', 'i stood firm ', 'we waited long for news of the  lone star  of savannah  but none ever reached us ', 'they have been identified as her clothes  and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off  ', 'now do try to come  and i shall meet you with the dog cart at winchester ', 'i stared at it horror stricken  not knowing what was about to issue from it ', 'but will he see it  ', 'you must not interfere  come what may ', 'he snatched it from her in his eagerness  and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently ', 'pray give me the results of your newspaper selections  ', ' i had   said he   come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows  my dear watson  how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data ', 'they still live with their old servants  who probably know so much of rucastle s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them ', 'oh  it is so dreadfully still in there  ', ' but this maid  alice  as i understand  deposes that she went to her room  covered her bride s dress with a long ulster  put on a bonnet  and went out  ', 'on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared  mr  aloysius doran  in conjunction with the bridegroom  instantly put themselves in communication with the police  and very energetic inquiries are being made  which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business ', 'it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement  who insists upon seeing me ', ' very sorry to knock you up  watson   said he   but it s the common lot this morning ', 'however  i must not sit gossiping here  but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self  ', ' my name is sherlock holmes ', 'it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation  ', 'and which king  ', 'then he lit his pipe  and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling ', ' oh  anstruther would do your work for you ', 'shouted another ', 'but my memory and my girl ', 'there were meetings  and an engagement  which would finally secure the girl s affections from turning towards anyone else ', '  this is mr  jabez wilson   said my assistant   and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league  ', 'then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe  which was to him as a counsellor  and  having lit it  he leaned back in his chair  with the thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him  and a look of infinite languor in his face ', 'from outside came the occasional cry of a night bird  and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine  which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty ', '  there are three missing ', ' is there a cellar with a good strong lock  ', 'he held out his snuffbox of old gold  with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid ', 'having taken the printed description ', 'says she ', 'i am a dangerous man to fall foul of ', ' here are the very letters ', ' then put on your hat and come ', ' alas ', 'a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows  for my father was a man of a very violent temper ', ' is it possible  ', ' i say that i have solved it  ', 'i think it was before your time  watson ', 'he asked ', 'as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone  so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones  both before and after ', ' i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case  ', 'oh  what shall i do  ', 'the sun was shining very brightly  and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air  which set an edge to a man s energy ', ' how do you know  then  ', ' it certainly sounds feasible  ', 'you look cold  mr  ryder ', ' the matter was perfectly simple ', ' my dear holmes  ', ' yes  it is correct  as far as it goes  ', ' thank you ', ' yes  but very small ones ', 'asked holmes with a start ', ' well  it is conjectured to be so ', 'mark that point ', '  to eyford  in berkshire ', 'there could be no doubt that  as it was a national possession  a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it ', 'it is three now ', ' so i see   the other answered with the utmost coolness ', 'the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance ', ' arms  azure  three caltrops in chief over a fess sable ', 'i know that everything was turning round  and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear ', 'now  if you are well up in your london  you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street  which branches out of upper swandam lane  where you found me to night ', ' do you know  watson   said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness   i have really some scruples as to taking you to night ', 'said he ', 'i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column ', 'this gentleman  mr  wilson  has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases  and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also  ', 'pray continue your most interesting statement  ', 'i rushed upstairs  explained the matter shortly to my wife  and in five minutes was inside a hansom  driving with my new acquaintance to baker street ', 'paul s  ', ' was the window open  ', 'we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in ', ' i think you will find   said sherlock holmes   that you will play for a higher stake to night than you have ever done yet  and that the play will be more exciting ', 'we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30 000 napoleons from the bank of france ', 'but come in ', ' well  the snuff  then  and the freemasonry  ', ' well  that is clear enough  certainly ', ' indeed   said holmes ', ' perhaps  mrs  moulton  you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter  ', 'it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name  as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket  was john openshaw  and whose residence is near horsham ', ' well  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates ', 'there was never any mystery in the matter  though  as i said yesterday  some of the details are of interest ', 'you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing  or even of understanding ', '  it is your only chance   said she ', ' you would have done better to have trusted your wife  ', 'at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead  where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes ', 'he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant  hardly knowing what to say or do  i was so pleased at my own good fortune ', ' there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship ', 'he was a lawyer ', ' to an english lawyer named norton  ', 'let me explain ', 'ryder quivered with emotion ', ' this is a very deep business   he said at last ', ' well  mr  holmes  when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard  and two or three bills upon the table  i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing ', 'the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for ', ' witness  it conveyed no meaning to me ', 'suddenly  however  as i ran  a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me ', ' well  obviously it could not have been meant for the son ', 'what of it  then ', 'he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key ', ' and now  lord st  simon  i think that i have nearly all my data ', 'of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime ', 'the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle ', ' for the love of heaven  ', ' you have come to me to tell your story  have you not  ', ' the glass still keeps very high   he remarked as he sat down ', 'it was only to day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you  ', ' i met him first at the gasfitters  ball   she said ', ' oh  dear ', 'the body exhibited no traces of violence  and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident  which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing stages  ', ' no  ', ' tired looking or fresh  ', 'why should i slink away without having carried out my commission  and without the payment which was my due ', 'with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor ', ' i have had nothing else to do  ', ' then  how do you know  ', 'will you not wait and breakfast  ', ' the  lone star  had arrived here last week ', 'it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire  and within seven miles of reading ', 'as i gave a last hurried glance around  i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards  which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward ', ' eh ', 'but why  ', ' i begin to think  watson   said holmes   that i make a mistake in explaining ', ' you can understand   said holmes suavely   that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours  ', ' extremely so ', 'she has her freedom  ', 'he took a large villa  laid out the grounds very nicely  and lived generally in good style ', 'he was a middle sized man  coarsely clad as became his calling  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat ', 'good day to you  miss hunter  ', 'holmes stooped to the water jug  moistened his sponge  and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner s face ', 'then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared  and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones ', 'let me introduce you to mr  merryweather  who is to be our companion in to night s adventure  ', '  no friend of yours  miss hunter  ', 'i have no idea what she meant  ', 'a double carriage sweep  with a snow clad lawn  stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance ', 'i never will again ', 'it may well have been cause and effect ', 'come in  ', ' oh  it won t do  really it won t   said holmes suavely ', 'those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride  ', ' no  ', 'he was  as the inspector had said  extremely dirty  but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness ', 'some little distance down threadneedle street  upon the left hand side  there is  as you may have remarked  a small angle in the wall ', ' i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience ', 'we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find ', 'but the inspector was mistaken  for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice ', 'your right hand is quite a size larger than your left ', 'our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh ', ' which are  ', 'ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips ', ' but of what society  ', 'already i was unable to stand erect  when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart ', 'cried sherlock holmes ', 'then i do not think that i need to detain you longer ', 'you  of course  saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice ', 'lucy parr  who had brought in the coffee  had  i am sure  left the room  but i cannot swear that the door was closed ', 'i ejaculated ', ' what have you done  ', 'yet  with all this  you made me reveal what you wanted to know ', ' and now  ', 'i should like a few particulars as to this young lady  and your relations to her  ', 'large sitting room on the right side  well furnished  with long windows almost to the floor  and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open ', 'a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead ', ' but  surely  it was obvious ', 'having laid out all these luxuries  my two visitors vanished away  like the genii of the arabian nights  with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address ', 'i was preoccupied with business matters  ', ' i am to remain neutral  to get near the window  to watch you  and at the signal to throw in this object  then to raise the cry of fire  and to wait you at the corner of the street  ', 'he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look ', 'suddenly  to my horror  there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room ', 'never trust to general impressions  my boy  but concentrate yourself upon details ', 'i would take my goose now  and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn ', 'by profession i am a hydraulic engineer  and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner   matheson  the well known firm  of greenwich ', 'he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son ', 'with a stout bearing  therefore  though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess  i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was ', 'here is where the party with the lodge keeper came  and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body ', 'you knew that this man horner  the plumber  had been concerned in some such matter before  and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him ', 'i nodded again ', ' i ve had enough of you and your geese   he shouted ', 'this man  however  was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up ', 'pray what is your own theory as to what took place  ', ' then  pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat  ', 'i was frightened of the house  of the man  of the woman  of the servants  even of the child ', 'as he glanced down the advertisement column  with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee  i took a good look at the man and endeavoured  after the fashion of my companion  to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance ', 'it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl  how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow  of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet ', 'the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear ', 'you have been looking a little pale lately ', 'he carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand  while he wore across the upper part of his face  extending down past the cheekbones  a black vizard mask  which he had apparently adjusted that very moment  for his hand was still raised to it as he entered ', ' you horrify me  ', 'i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you ', 'why ', 'posted to day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ', ' what is the name of this obliging youth  ', 'he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight  for he said that he hated to be conspicuous ', ' that was it   said holmes  nodding approvingly   i have no doubt of it ', 'it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in  dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever  and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features ', ' it was only a joke at first   groaned our visitor ', ' and he is a man with a wooden leg  ', 'do you understand  ', 'mrs  st  clair had her lunch  started for the city  did some shopping  proceeded to the company s office  got her packet  and found herself at exactly 4 35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station ', ' no  my brougham is waiting  ', 'said mr  jabez wilson ', 'you see this little book  ', 'in the road stood our horse and trap  with the half clad stable boy waiting at the head ', 'she was flattered by the gentleman s attentions  and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother ', ' you will excuse me   said holmes blandly   but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now ', 'when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him  and finding that he would not tell me the story  i told it to him  on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me ', 'the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room  a very fat and burly man  with a heavy stick in his hand ', 'must i call you a liar as well as a thief ', 'i walked down to the station with them  and then wandered through the streets of the little town  finally returning to the hotel  where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow backed novel ', 'sherlock holmes laughed ', ' if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here  ', 'i rose to go  but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair ', 'ordering my cab to wait  i passed down the steps  worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet  and by the light of a flickering oil lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long  low room  thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke  and terraced with wooden berths  like the forecastle of an emigrant ship ', 'i answered ', ' you don t mind breaking the law  ', ' i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions   he said ', ' seven  ', 'yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power ', 'mr  merryweather is the chairman of

must have a cab  ', 'to carry the art  however  to its highest pitch  it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge  and this in itself

is a pen ', ' i believe that he is coming here   said holmes  rubbing his hands ', 'my dear wife knew that i had business in the city ', ' i told you that i would call  ', 'he cried ', 'here you are

questions which have to be solved  what neville st  clair was doing in the opium den  what happened to him when there  where is he now  and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance  are all as far from a solution as ever ', ' yes  i fancy we may have some company dropping in   said he ', ' i am afraid that you will find it difficult  ', ' yes  all  ', 'asked arthur ', ' the band ', 'yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features  for he was running hard  with occasional little springs  such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax

right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope  i must be dull  indeed  if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession  ', '  precisely  ', 'it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you  a young and unknown man  a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession ', 'he rushed down  just as he was

time as possible  so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences  ', ' i did as he ordered  and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room ', ' it is a curious thing   remarked holmes   that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man s handwriting ', 'if they fire  watson  have no compunction about shooting them down  ', 'but i see that the enemy s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light ', 'if his purpose were innocent  why did he not say so  ', 'stay where you are ', ' pray do  sir  if it may help to clear this horrible affair up  ', 'i met him that night  and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe  and after that we met him  that is to say  mr  holmes  i met him twice for walks  but

stories ', 'that is interesting   said holmes ', 'it seemed to me to be something grey in colour  a coat of some sort  or a plaid perhaps ', 'the shutters cut off the least ray of light  and we waited in absolute darkness ', 'having once made up my mind  you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof ', ' i suppose   i remarked   that  homely as it looks  this thing has

arthur  ', 'at last  however  the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive  and the carriage came to a stand ', ' i glanced at the books upon the table  and in

yes  it was twisted  ', 'what was the relation between them  and what the object of his repeated visits ', ' i will tell you  then  what occurred in your house last night ', ' all right   said jones

her little son ', 'by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle ', ' what is it  ', 'i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse ', 'the road topped a low hill  and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us  spouting fire at every chink and window  while in the garden in front three fire engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under ', 'i am not hysterical  nor given to fainting ', 'you just read it for yourself  sir  ', 'then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion ', 'in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door  so he rose and  looking out  was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing room ', ' it appears that his arrest did not take place at once  but after the return to hatherley farm ', ' how long did she speak to this alice  ', ' what will the duke say   he murmured   when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation  ', ' a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it ', 'the same porter was on duty  i found  as had been there when i arrived ', '  this is my secretary and manager   said the colonel ', 'in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings  i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade  of scotland yard ', 'light a cigar and let me expound  ', ' i see  her ladyship s waiting maid ', 'you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes ', ' this photograph  ', 'well  there is the tower of the cathedral  and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell  ', ' i was aware of it   said holmes dryly ', 'how you startled me  kate ', ' yes  and she was the girl who waited in the drawing room  and who may have heard uncle s remarks about the coronet  ', 'i asked   the same as the one i chose  ', '  is 4 pounds a week  ', 'tut  ', 'and there is a little reward  i fancy ', ' how is the glass ', 'said he ', ' i believe  mr  holmes  that you have already made up your mind   said miss stoner  laying her hand upon my companion s sleeve ', 'tiptoes ', ' but if i am to go  i must pack at once  for i have only half an hour  ', 'he raised his hand ', ' i was very angry  for this was the third demand during the month ', ' the vanishing of the lady  ', 'obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it ', ' i fished about with a rake ', ' good heavens  ', 'her violet eyes shining  her lips parted  a pink flush upon her cheeks  all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern ', ' he says four o clock ', 'with a dazed face the banker made out the required check ', 'god help me  ', 'nothing simpler ', '  and how far from the edge of the wood  ', ' perhaps we had better proceed to business  then   said he ', 'it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way    have you a couple of days to spare ', 'come on  my boy  and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock  ', ' here we are  ', 'finally he returned to the pawnbroker s  and  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times  he went up to the door and knocked ', ' i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl ', 'a few yards off he stopped under a lamp post and laughed in the hearty  noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him ', 'your news of this morning  however  may open his lips  ', ' d you think you know more about fowls than i  who have handled them ever since i was a nipper ', 'he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand ', 'i whispered   did you see it  ', 'you have been reading the papers diligently of late  have you not  ', 'it s a cold night   said holmes ', ' but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion ', ' now  watson   said holmes  as a tall dog cart dashed up through the gloom  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns ', ' it is quite a pretty little problem   said he ', 'father was a plumber in the tottenham court road  and he left a tidy business behind him  which mother carried on with mr  hardy  the foreman  but when mr  windibank came he made her sell the business  for he was very superior  being a traveller in wines ', 'and no more words were needed ', ' certainly  ', ' i am afraid so ', 'should i stop the service and make a scene in the church ', 'but  after all  if he is satisfied  why should i put ideas in his head  ', 'i sat down beside the fire  however  with the intention of awaiting him  however long he might be ', 'however  i shall write two letters  which should settle the matter ', ' but she could not love him  ', 'i say it is south  for the country is more deserted there  ', 'he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road ', 'asked holmes  glancing up ', 'i hope that i have made myself clear  ', ' if i claim full justice for my art  it is because it is an impersonal thing  a thing beyond myself ', 'two attempts of the sort have already been made ', 'a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled  who had been sitting in the window  rose as we entered ', 'but now the spell had been upon him eight and forty hours  and he lay there  doubtless among the dregs of the docks  breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects ', ' read it aloud  ', ' oh  indeed ', 'he advanced slowly into the room  turning his head from left to right  and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses ', 'la scala  hum ', 'i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning  or what i ended by doing  ', ' i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help ', 'and about his quarrel with his father  i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it  ', 'i threw myself  screaming  against the door  and dragged with my nails at the lock ', 'the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry  cooee  ', 'the very first key fitted to perfection  and i drew the drawer open ', ' i will do so  and i must be quick  for i have promised mr  rucastle to be back before three ', ' you really are very fine indeed ', 'might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes  and not to interfere  ', ' your own deathbeds  when they come  will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine  ', 'vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful  so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me ', ' that is well ', 'we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate  and a short walk took us to saxe coburg square  the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning ', ' can i be of assistance  ', ' here it is   said he presently     ku klux klan ', '  it s only four hours a day  and i should not think of leaving   said i ', ' and has your business been attended to in your absence  ', 'astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands  ', ' nothing  ', 'i sprang from my bed  wrapped a shawl round me  and rushed into the corridor ', ' what ', ' my messenger reached you  then  ', 'he took an orange from the cupboard  and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table ', ' i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until  some time later  i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 pounds ', ' god bless you  ', ' you have an answer to everything ', 'the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress  the letter was superscribed to  sherlock holmes  esq ', 'this was clearly the cause of the loss of power  and i pointed it out to my companions  who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right ', 'the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire ', ' could he throw no light  ', ' ah  ', 'he drew up the windows on either side  tapped on the wood work  and away we went as fast as the horse could go  ', 'now the question is  where are we to find the photograph  ',

have it  ', ' you must act  man  or you are lost ', 'he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room ', 'it seems that there had been some informality about their license  that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort  and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man ', 'i went and saw him ', 'i could see that she was pretty  and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material ', 'it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison  ', ' quite so ', 'i sponged the wound  cleaned it  dressed it  and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages ', ' tut ', ' except yourself i have none   he answered ', 'there are several people in the neighbourhood  however  and among them miss turner  the daughter of the neighbouring landowner  who believe in his innocence  and who have retained lestrade  whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet  to work out the case in his interest ', 'you are holmes  the meddler  ', ' you have carte blanche  ', 'i got his leave to come into town this morning  though he little knew for what purpose  ', '  i should much prefer to have it so   said he  raising up a square  black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair ', 'i rose  and  making my excuses  escaped from the house ', ' the leader of the gang ', 'all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh ', 'had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour s purchase  for i have used it before now for my own purposes  and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me ', 'you will sign it  and watson here can witness it ', 'it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes  ', ' i perceive that all is as it should be ', 'she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question  and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand ', 'we have already a clue ', ' well  moonshine is a brighter thing than fog   said holmes  laughing ', ' oh  no  sir ', 'holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent  while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down  taking in every detail of the apartment ', 'his cheeks were red  his brow was all crinkled with anger  and the veins stood out at his temples with passion ', 'we are but preventing her from injuring another

world ', ' i am for west   remarked the plain clothes man ', ' i will not look  ', ' he is a man who leads a sedentary life  goes out little  is out of training entirely  is middle aged  has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days  and which he anoints with lime cream ', ' none of those which come to me are ', 'a mole could trace it  and there it vanishes among the reeds ', ' i answered that i had not ', 'he was not a popular man  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners  but he had  as far as i know  no active enemies ', 'he was doing something in the cellar  something which took many hours a day for months on end ', 'her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty  but her hair was shot with premature grey  and her expression was weary and haggard ', ' thank god for that ', ' none at all ', 'but look at these lonely houses  each in its own fields  filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law ', 'the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation ', ' only one little item in another of the morning papers  but it is a suggestive one  ', 'here he comes ', 'his face set hard  and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes ', ' and now you must on no account lose another instant ', ' i find it hard enough to tackle facts  holmes  without flying away after theories and fancies  ', 'but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house  ', ' and this  of course  remains to you  since the marriage is a fait accompli  ', ' yes   i answered  laughing ', ' what  ', 'how he did it i could not imagine  but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd  and right up to the steps which led to the office ', 'when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me  and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople  so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house ', 'but then  as i used to say to mother  a woman wants her own circle to begin with  and i had not got mine yet  ', 'the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest  fighting against his emotion ', ' it has been in some points a singular case   said holmes  flicking the horse on into a gallop ', 'i do not know at what hour he came in  but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other  as fresh and trim as possible ', 'both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon ', 'putting his hands into his pockets  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes ', 'she cried breathlessly ', 'it was a long fight between my pride and the money  but the dollars won at last  and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen  inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers ', '  on the contrary   said i   i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close  ', 'holmes walked over to his desk  took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it  and threw it down upon the table ', ' you are sure that she has not sent it yet  ', 'the adventure of the blue carbuncle  i had called upon my friend sherlock

very curly brimmed hat  was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top ', 'my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty ', 'now from this double point our research must commence  and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true  ', 'holmes gazed long and earnestly at it ', 'i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly  ', ' our quest is practically finished ', 'see what my wife found in its crop  ', ' i have just been there  and i have taken it out  and i have got it in this gladstone bag ',

amid even greater perils than did the sholtos  ', 'and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view ', 'once we diverted her luggage when she travelled ', ' i should wish to  ', 'i slept at baker street that night  and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room ', ' well  and what happened when mr  windibank  your stepfather  returned to france  ', ' in which  sir  ', ' there were none ', 'becher s  ', 'it was the toy which he had promised to bring home ', ' it is a murder  then  ', ' but it might have been a cry of surprise ', ' mr ', 'among these he rummaged and read  with intervals of note taking and of meditation  until we were past reading ', 'we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him ', 'you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south  and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered  ', 'you did not know where to look  and so you missed all that was important ', 'what do you want  ', ' this has been done   said i  examining the wound   by a very heavy and sharp instrument  ', 'my first glance is always at a woman s sleeve ', ' now for mr  breckinridge   he continued  buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air ', 'when i remembered that you had seen her at that window  and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again  my conjecture became a certainty ', 'now   he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided   i must discuss it while i eat  for i have not much time ', ' mrs  rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature ', 'he asked at last pointing to a thick bell rope which hung down beside the bed  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow ', 'by degrees mr  duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning  and then  after a time  he did not come in at all ', ' and now a word as to my household  mr  holmes  for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation ', 'i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing  but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring  or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man ', ' none at all   said holmes ', 'just before nine o clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room ', 'he has little time  for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up  and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street ', 'besides  she is not so very young ', 'i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep  and indeed was nodding myself  when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece ', ' quite so  at the gold mines  where  as i understand  mr  turner made his money  ', 'sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform  his tall  gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling cloak and close fitting cloth cap ', '  dear miss hunter   miss stoper has very kindly given me your address  and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision ', 'this account of you we have from all quarters received ', 'what a shrimp it is  to be sure  ', 'as you may observe  mr  holmes  my hair is somewhat luxuriant  and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut ', ' why  it s a dummy   said he ', 'on the table stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open  throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe  the door of which was ajar ', 'two hours passed slowly away  and then  suddenly  just at the stroke of eleven  a single bright light shone out right in front of us ', ' well  it was the beginning of  84 when my father came to live at horsham  and all went as well as possible with us until the january of  85 ', ' you see it  watson  ', '  well   said i   the gentleman at no ', ' perhaps we may make them less so  ', 'she had small round  hanging gold earrings  and a general air of being fairly well to do in a vulgar  comfortable  easy going way  ', 'no one else  i think  ', '  yes  i promise  ', 'i swear it ', ' by the select prices ', ' you see  mr  holmes   said he   my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man ', '  oh  very well ', ' very glad to see you ', ' what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches  and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk  ', ' but the twelve mile drive  ', 'it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor  ', 'ah  me ', 'it might be a lover  it might be a husband ', 'i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo ', ' you shut up the windows and doors the night before ', ' i will go when i have said my say ', ' nor running a chance of arrest  ', 'then my friend rose and threw open the door ', 'i had said to her last night  in sorrow and not in anger  that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him ', ' it is not yet nine ', 'it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london ', 'i painted my face  and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh coloured plaster ', 'every morning i was there at ten  and every afternoon i left at two ', ' you have really got it  ', 'i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible  and hence my preference for a dirty face ', 'i know that miss stoner has been here ', 'there would be one to reading in less than an hour ', 'he rummaged amid his newspapers  glancing over the dates  until at last he smoothed one out  doubled it over  and read the following paragraph

mind   said holmes  laughing   it is my business to know things ', 'still  it might be worth while to call holmes  attention to it ', 'i soon found briony lodge ', 'a case of identity   my dear fellow

deception could not be kept up forever ', 'you must yourself have remarked how worn  wrinkled  and stained they were ', 'then  when i flash a light upon them  close in swiftly ', 'i was the only

regretted the rashness of my speech ', ' then i do not see the point  ', 'have the goodness  also  when you address me always to say  sir  and  please   ', 'on examining it  however  i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one  and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left  both of them  however  in the grounds of my neighbours ', ' may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character  ', ' it is his hat  ', 'this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside  and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness ', ' we could see the other side of the road and the park  ', 'when i came down  mr  rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog cart to the copper beeches ', 'a large face

strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy s innocence ', 'far from hushing the thing up  i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it  ', ' he must guard himself  for

cannot  and i will not  believe it  ', '  it is also my custom   said he  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face   to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand  so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe  ', ' by the way  i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now ', ' surely it would not be difficult to find out ', 'he was kind to her also in his bluff  boisterous fashion  and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple ', 'holmes laughed

found that it was still bleeding  so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig  ', 'as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a

should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair ', ' yes  my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety   he answered  smiling   and the humbler are

me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door ', 'it is my business to know what other people don t know  ', 'i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter s words  and

visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman  obese  pompous  and slow ', 'o  ', ' i am afraid the doctor won t allow it  ', 'and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as

most clumsy and careless servant girl  ', 'there were six of us  and we had a wild  free life of it  sticking up a station from time to time  or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings ', 'i never noticed that before  ', 'the most lay silent  but some muttered to themselves  and others talked together in a strange  low  monotonous voice  their conversation coming in gushes  and then suddenly tailing off into silence  each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour ', ' stoke moran  ', 'holmes whistled ', ' i reached this one   said my friend   by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag ', ' still  i confess that i miss my rubber ', 'interjected holmes ', 'he waved his hands frantically to her  and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind ', 'she is waiting now in the sitting room ', 'we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible  and out into the bright morning sunshine ', 'it may be some time before i get back ', 'he roared ', 'sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders ', ' get out  ', 'it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data ', 'i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool  with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side ', 'we waited  all curiosity  until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story ', ' and that is      that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine  ', 'he drank more than ever  and he was less inclined for any sort of society ', ' at what time  ', 'i shall have the others  but he first  ', 'we both put our eyes to the grating ', 'i took two steps forward and looked back ', ' hum ', 'of course  i did not mind you so much  as you are not connected with the official police  but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad ', ' what  ', 'we had walked several times up and down the lawn  neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie ', 'he is older than arthur  a man of the world to his finger tips  one who had been everywhere  seen everything  a brilliant talker  and a man of great personal beauty ', 'when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of  cooee  ', 'there was not a bird to be seen there ', 'nothing but energy can save you ', ' oh  a trusty comrade is always of use  and a chronicler still more so ', 'you seem most fortunate in having an employ  who comes under the full market price ', ' ha ', ' ten will be early enough  ', 'he was at work again ', 'the rooms were carefully examined  and results all pointed to an abominable crime ', ' this hat has not been brushed for weeks ', ' well  i guess you have every cause to be  ', 'i hurled it out of the window  and it disappeared into the thames ', 'it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so ', 'i paced up and down the room  humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty guinea fee ', 'i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him  ', 'i lay listening with all my ears ', ' two years have passed since then  and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever ', 'he is one of the most dangerous men in england  a ruined gambler  an absolutely desperate villain  a man without heart or conscience ', 'inspector barton  who had charge of the case  made a very careful examination of the premises  but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter ', ' with the result of driving it through the ventilator  ', 'i m not rich  but still i have a hundred a year in my own right  besides the little that i make by the machine  and i would give it all to know what has become of mr  hosmer angel  ', 'but you ve got mixed  watson  for i have only been here a few hours  three pipes  four pipes  i forget how many ', 'the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist ', 'they put in the advertisement  one rogue has the temporary office  the other rogue incites the man to apply for it  and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week ', 'that is what makes me uneasy ', 'holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man s excited face ', 'i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms  although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us ', ' yes  miss ', 'mr  rucastle seemed to be a very kind  good natured man ', 'on the one hand  of course  i was glad  for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services  and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones ', 'i asked ', ' not invisible but unnoticed  watson ', 'this is my point  ', ' he is dead   cried several voices ', ' there   said he  putting a new wedding ring upon the top of the pile ', 'i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance ', ' it s only carlo  my mastiff ', 'i am a widower and have an only son  arthur ', 'her dress was brown  rather darker than coffee colour  with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves ', ' a confidential servant  ', ' it s all clear   he whispered ', '  i would go   said she  trying hard  as it seemed to me  to speak calmly   i would go ', ' they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them  ', 'saturday would suit them better than any other day  as it would give them two days for their escape ', 'i will leave the country  sir ', ' from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty   said holmes coldly ', '  ten to two  ', 'still  that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete ', '  precisely so ', 'she asked ', 'from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion ', 'in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes ', 'you suppose that your son came down from his bed  went  at great risk  to your dressing room  opened your bureau  took out your coronet  broke off by main force a small portion of it  went off to some other place  concealed three gems out of the thirty nine  with such skill that nobody can find them  and then returned with the other thirty six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered ', ' i confess that i still share my uncle s perplexity  ', ' my last client of the sort was a king  ', 'now  you must have some wine and water  and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it ', ' on the contrary  watson  you can see everything ', 'he s forty one years of age  which is mature for marriage ', ' then you won t forgive me ', 'he asked ', 'but there i was firm ', ' well  but china  ', 'our cabs were dismissed  and  following the guidance of mr  merryweather  we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door  which he opened for us ', 'sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last  having apparently given up his search  he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings ', ' i have seen those symptoms before   said holmes  throwing his cigarette into the fire ', 'to do this  we must try the simplest means first  and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers ', 'shall be glad if you will come with me ', 'and  first of all  we must choose our positions ', 'your niece  when you had  as she thought  gone to your room  slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane ', 'i took a few of my friends into the secret  however  and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields ', 'fleet street was choked with red headed folk  and pope s court looked like a coster s orange barrow ', ' what do you think  watson ', ' you ll come with me  won t you  ', 'he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly  a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance  followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses  hoofs ', ' yes  i shall not feel easy until i have told my story  ', 'he was in a pitiable state of reaction  with every nerve in a twitter ', 'the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child  ', '  most admirably  ', 'philosophy  astronomy  and politics were marked at zero  i remember ', ' yes  but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms ', 'flora was a dear little thing  but exceedingly hot headed and devotedly attached to me ', ' oh  i have heard of that fellow   answered my visitor   and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up  though of course i must use the official police as well ', ' last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw  to my horror and astonishment  that my wife was standing in the street  with her eyes fixed full upon me ', ' i started off  mr  holmes  but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps  and no one in it had ever heard of either mr  william morris or mr  duncan ross  ', 'and now  and now i am myself a branded thief  without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character ', ' well  certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis   said holmes  smiling ', 'describe it  ', 'then the charge against him will break down  ', 'there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner  a scissors grinder with his wheel  two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl  and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths ', ' which key was used to open it  ', ' and they were posted to day at gravesend ', 'he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands ', 'but that is a mere detail ', 'it is in the personal column of the morning post  and dates  as you see  some weeks back   a marriage has been arranged   it says   and will  if rumour is correct  very shortly take place  between lord robert st  simon  second son of the duke of balmoral  and miss hatty doran  the only daughter of aloysius doran ', ' yes  sir  that be the house of dr  grimesby roylott   remarked the driver ', 'but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results ', 'the man s business was a small one  and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations  and such an expenditure as they were at ', 'holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen ', ' of what  ', 'i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to night when she meets me at the door  ', 'my sister asked me what was the matter  and why i was so pale  but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel ', 'tottering and shaking in all his giant frame  he stumbled slowly from the room ', ' god help us  ', 'why should she hand it over to anyone else ', 'from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do  ', ' i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town ', 'i returned the strange hair to the drawer  and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked ', ' i do not wish to make a mystery   said he  laughing ', ' about sixty  but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad  and he has been in failing health for some time ', ' yes   said holmes  answering the look rather than the words ', 'said he as he took it up   pondicherry postmark ', ' the doctors examined her for it  but without success  ', '  yes  ', 'i knew the firm for which this man worked ', 'then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack ', 'i hardened my heart  and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster ', ' circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing   answered holmes thoughtfully ', 'a stable boy had run out to the horse s head  and springing down  i followed holmes up the small  winding gravel drive which led to the house ', 'beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar  its silence broken only by the heavy  regular footfall of the policeman  or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers ', '  what  you dig fuller s earth in the house  ', 'by jove  ', ' i say  watson  what o clock is it  ', 'it may stop his gossip ', ' you did it very nicely  doctor   he remarked ', ' but i am somewhat headstrong by nature  and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way ', 'you see  watson  our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect ', 'god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he ', 'b  ', 'behind there was nothing remarkable  save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house ', 'i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also  and i instantly lit the light and attacked it  ', ' of course you are ', ' quite so ', ' he is still with you  ', 'you may safely trust him  for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief ', '  we have judged it best that you should come late ', ' we re hunting in couples again  doctor  you see   said jones in his consequential way ', 'on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill  and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom ', ' he often had a wild way of talking  so that i thought little of what he said ', 'the goose we retained until this morning  when there were signs that  in spite of the slight frost  it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay ', ' i advertised for him in last saturday s chronicle   said she ', 'mary was the first to rush into my room  and  at the sight of the coronet and of arthur s face  she read the whole story and  with a scream  fell down senseless on the ground ', 'we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak  ', 'we got to the church first  and when the four wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out  but he never did  and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there ', ' quite so ', 'what is this  then ', 'james and his father had many disagreements about me ', ' in your heart of hearts  do you think that neville is alive  ', ' the case is as plain as a pikestaff  and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes ', 'he was a late riser  as a rule  and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven  i blinked up at him in some surprise  and perhaps just a little resentment  for i was myself regular in my habits ', 'you re mad ', 'a fierce quarrel broke out  which was increased by the two guardsmen  who took sides with one of the loungers  and by the scissors grinder  who was equally hot upon the other side ', 'the culprit is      mr  john turner   cried the hotel waiter  opening the door of our sitting room  and ushering in a visitor ', ' oh  no  sir ', 'she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead  and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs ', ' exactly so ', ' one of the highest in england  ', 'i am prepared to leave it with you as my security  ', 'i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked  so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy ', ' what s up  then  ', ' stop it  ', 'having found the ash  i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it ', ' oh  that ', 'making our way among the trees  we reached the lawn  crossed it  and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child  who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness ', 'having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points  holmes desired to be led to the court yard  from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool ', ' there is the writing  ', 'with an apology for my intrusion  i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me ', 'there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken ', 'his boots  his socks  his hat  and his watch  all were there ', ' well  ', ' why does fate play such tricks with poor  helpless worms ', 'the presence of the gipsies  and the use of the word  band   which was used by the poor girl  no doubt  to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match  were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent ', ' you see it is really confined to londoners  and to grown men ', 'his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase  and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears  or  at the most  only provoked a quick  impatient snarl in reply ', ' i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to night ', 'mr  fowler and miss rucastle were married  by special license  in southampton the day after their flight  and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius ', ' i will soon make it clear to you   said she   and i d have done so before now if i could ha  got out from the cellar ', 'i never saw a more inexorable face in my life  ', ' good day  lord st  simon   said holmes  rising and bowing ', 'it ran  if i remember right   sent the pips to a  b  and c   that is  sent the society s warning to them ', 'he placed his finger in the centre of the circle ', ' yes  they have shown extraordinary energy ', 'they were always very careful  i observed  to turn my face away from the window  so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back ', 'in front of him he saw  in the gaslight  a tallish man  walking with a slight stagger  and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder ', 'in this case  however  they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man  ', 'so and so  of ballarat  ', ' i ve heard that voice before   said holmes  staring down the dimly lit street ', ' i shall glance into the case for you   said holmes  rising   and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result ', 'of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope ', 'as far as the church door he brought her  and then  as he could go no farther  he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other ', ' why did you beat the pavement  ', 'i confess that i felt easier in my mind when  after following holmes  example and slipping off my shoes  i found myself inside the bedroom ', 'well  mrs  st  clair  the clouds lighten  though i should not venture to say that the danger is over  ', 'but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us ', 'she cried in english   remember your promise after the last time ', 'for the rest  it was cracked  exceedingly dusty  and spotted in several places  although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink ', 'his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in

or left the country  and finally that c was visited  with  i fear  a sinister result for c  well  i think  doctor  that we may let some light into this dark place  and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him ', ' there you are   said he ', 'three gilt balls and a brown board with  jabez wilson  in white letters  upon a corner house

was in me to be ', 'i shall communicate with you  ', 'i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers  ', 'but what could it indicate ', 'i gave a cry of surprise  threw up my arms to cover my face  and  rushing to my confidant  the lascar  entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me ', 'it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland ', ' my stepfather s business papers  ', 'it was late before sherlock holmes returned ', ' mr  sherlock holmes  i believe  ', ' all is lost  ', 'heh  ', ' if you choose to call the police  let the police find what they can  ', 'they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews  and knew all about him ', ' do you go out much in society  ', 'it was obvious to me that my companion s mind was now made up about the case  although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine ', 'as i dressed i glanced at my watch ', 'the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting room and led into a small bedroom  which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves ', 'for an hour or more he was at work  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever ', 'he asked ', ' i hear that it was during the night  sir  but it has got worse  and the whole place is in a blaze  ', 'it must be done at once ', 'it is certain  therefore  that my sister was quite alone when she met her end ', ' very well ', ' oh  you must not discourage me  mr  holmes ', 'mrs  st  clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal  and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague ', 'it was a delicate part which i had to play then  for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal  and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter ', 'when the commissionaire had gone  holmes took up the stone and held it against the light ', 'the pipe was still between his lips  the smoke still curled upward  and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze  but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night ', 'one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly  as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar  but this fault was soon remedied  and he was seized and searched  without anything being found which could incriminate him ', 'i asked when i had finished ', 'this fellow will not go wrong again  he is too terribly frightened ', 'as i have reason to believe  however  that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public  and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up  i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode ', ' i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty s business to a more successful conclusion  ', ' and your father ', 'holmes chuckled heartily ', ' i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories ', 'i must compliment you  ', ' and i feel dissatisfied ', 'i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him  ', ' what are you going to do  then  ', ' but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time ', 'it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman ', ' but it is profoundly true ', 'lestrade looked startled ', '  not so many as you might think   he answered ', '  but  madam   said i   i have not yet done what i came for ', 'the lamps had been lit  but the blinds had not been drawn  so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch ', 'in two hours we must be on the scene of action ', ' now lead the way  and we shall soon see the end of this black business  ', ' my dear fellow  i would not miss it for anything  ', 'for the rest  there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note books bearing upon my uncle s life in america ', ' i shall never let it drop until the gems are found  never  mary ', 'no  sir  i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true  and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us ', 'i asks ', 'a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened ', ' one  ', 'there s money in this case  watson  if there is nothing else  ', '  i had better put my hat on  i suppose  ', 'said he ', 'and so you won t cut your hair  ', 'there was one wing  however  which appeared not to be inhabited at all ', 'said mr  rucastle  showing me a slit between two planks ', 'there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify ', '  the firm does so when the security is good  ', 'how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads  ', 'this would be in the year 1878  after he had been eight or nine years in england ', 'be in your chamber then at that hour  and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask  ', 'men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town ', 'i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad  and just a little lower down was a long building  which proved  upon my approaching it  to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night ', 'the sleeper half turned  and then settled down once more into a deep slumber ', ' bought  ', 'a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose  but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening  and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature  or who would venture to set him free ', 'from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter  yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us ', ' i am endeavouring to tell you everything  mr  holmes  which may have any bearing upon the case  but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear  ', 'asked holmes ', 'i determined  therefore  that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me  so that it might never be really out of my reach ', ' you will remember that i remarked the other day  just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland  that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself  which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination  ', 'there was a long silence  during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire ', 'and yet  what could have happened ', 'mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet  but i thought it better not to disturb it ', ' well  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better ', 'said vincent spaulding ', 'then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter  ', 'said he ', 'it will end in my being conveyed into the house ', 'he caught up a pen ', 'i asked ', ' and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night  ', 'there is something distinctly novel about some of the features ', ' i am glad to hear you say so   said holmes gravely ', ' ha ', ' oh  we shall soon clear up all that   said bradstreet ', ' and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet   cried mr  holder ', 'where were we going  and what were we to do ', 'its disappearance  however  was but momentary ', ' well  i followed you to your door  and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr  sherlock holmes ', 'he shrieked  and then   my god  my god  my sins have overtaken me  ', 'this stone is not yet twenty years old ', 'there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe ', 'there is half a column of print  but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me ', ' that was it  sir  ', ' the postmark is london  eastern division ', 'my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you ', 'i sent the house maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once ', ' i see   said i as i glanced down the column   that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy ', 'look at the neat little  hosmer angel  at the bottom ', 'we should have acted before this ', ' i have very little difficulty in finding what i want   said i   for the facts are quite recent  and the matter struck me as remarkable ', 'it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money  and that it is still lying in our cellar ', 'i am going through the city first  and we can have some lunch on the way ', ' indeed ', ' i pray not  sir ', 'i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it ', 'the year  87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest  of which i retain the records ', 'to me it has been exceptionally so ', 'it was early in april in the year  83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing  fully dressed  by the side of my bed ', 'square  too  quite unusual boots ', 'one evening  after the child was in bed  i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things ', 'he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday school treat ', 'his boots  too  might be told from their traces  ', 'she smiled back at me  closed my door  and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock  ', 'it must  then  be something out of the house ', 'i thought i heard a ring  ', ' quite so  but the sequel was rather unusual ', 'i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it  but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears  and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose bushes ', ' then how many are there  ', 'he cried  grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face ', ' it is really very good of you to come  watson   said he ', 'he saw her stealthily open the window  hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom  and then closing it once more hurry back to her room  passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain ', 'there is not an instant to be lost ', 'i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her  but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else ', 'he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again ', 'john horner  26  plumber  was brought up upon the charge of having

will be here in an hour  ', 'it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle  save that it is blue in shade instead of

'on the other hand  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me  and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller s earth was sufficient to explain the necessity

be no doubt as to the nature of this gang  ', 'are you a married man  mr  wilson ', ' and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink  and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out  ', ' you have done well indeed  ', 'that will just show you how fond he was of me  mr  holmes  and the little things that he would think of  ', ' very good ',

right  were from a fish monger and a tide waiter  ', 'two days later  that is  on wednesday last  there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place  and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwater s place  near petersfield ', 'then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it ', 'perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so ', ' the knees of his trousers  ', 'now  i ll state the case clearly and concisely to you  watson  and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me  ', ' i have nothing to do to day

care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them  ', 'you are too timid in drawing your inferences  ', 'there has been no result  ', ' lady st  simon  then  returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it ', 'i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman  ', 'all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective  and  for all that it was a cold night  the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road ', 'and yet she had some secret sorrow  this woman ', 'i implored the colonel to let me out  but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries ', 'holmes turned to the page indicated ', 'it is cabinet size ', 'i imagine that you saw all that i did  ', ' but how  ', 'i cried ', 'i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme  which is rather more to my taste than italian or french ', 'suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light ', ' of course ', 'yet we have not a moment to lose ', '  i have heard so  ', 'the double line a little above the wrist  where the typewritist presses against the table  was beautifully defined ', 'upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major  imploring me to come at once ', 'she was very independent in little matters like that ', ' very strange  ', 'a sandwich and a cup of coffee  and then off to violin land  where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony  and there are no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums  ', 'my sister and i  you will recollect  were twins  and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied ', 'then i called at the offices round  but none of them seemed to know anything about it ', 'the manor house is  as i have already said  very old  and only one wing is now inhabited ', 'their papers they mean to have  be the holder of them who it may ', ' i will do nothing of the kind ', ' showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place ', 'i was young ', 'he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him ', 'boone  as i have told you  was arrested and taken to the station  but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him ', ' it goes to the housekeeper s room  ', 'it s not a very large affair  and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living ', 'i know that her word is inviolate ', ' never was such a fellow for photography ', 'as we approached  the door flew open  and a little blonde woman stood in the opening  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists ', ' god knows i have   a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason  so sudden and so terrible is it ', ' really  mr  holmes   said mr  merryweather as we followed them from the cellar   i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you ', ' when i went down there i found him talking with his son  so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone ', 'holmes laughed ', ' i should not be surprised if that were he ', 'the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough ', ' no  i shall commence with the city ', 'he would seize the coat  then  and be in the act of throwing it out  when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink ', 'giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement  and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice  little birds  and insects ', 'to morrow i shall set to work upon your case  ', 'the solemn mr  merryweather perched himself upon a crate  with a very injured expression upon his face  while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and  with the lantern and a magnifying lens  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones ', 'holmes took a note of it ', 'for example  how did you deduce that this man was intellectual  ', 'the summons was a brief and urgent one ', 'irene adler  as i will still call her  had hurried up the steps  but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall  looking back into the street ', ' the stable lane  ', ' i daresay that if i had put 100 pounds down in front of him  that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager ', 'i found sherlock holmes alone  however  half asleep  with his long  thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair ', 'as he loved his cousin  however  there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret  the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one ', ' oh  yes  mr  holmes ', ' why  i have lost four pound a week  ', 'tell us the truth  for there lies your only hope of safety  ', 'but it is too heavy a task ', ' i cannot say that i have  ', 'it is pleasant to me to observe  watson  that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up  and  i am bound to say  occasionally to embellish  you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c l bres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves  but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province  ', ' the first thing that put us out was that advertisement ', ' so much for mr  henry baker   said holmes when he had closed the door behind him ', 'what would he do then ', ' but his wife  you said that she had ceased to love him  ', ' pray take a seat   said holmes ', 'he had returned with the prize  but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent ', ' but mr  fowler being a persevering man  as a good seaman should be  blockaded the house  and having met you succeeded by certain arguments  metallic or otherwise  in convincing you that your interests were the same as his  ', ' and what did you see  ', 'holmes shook his head gravely ', 'john horner  a plumber  was accused of having abstracted it from the lady s jewel case ', 'holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar ', ' ah  bradstreet  how are you  ', ' your majesty has something which i should value even more highly   said holmes ', '  i am afraid that it is quite essential   said he ', '  and the work  ', 'i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it ', ' if you can do nothing better than laugh at me  i can go elsewhere  ', 'but then  when i found how i had betrayed myself  i began to think ', ' and you did very wisely   said holmes ', 'a moment later we were out on the dark road  a chill wind blowing in our faces  and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand ', ' let us have everything in its due order  ', 'after all  i thought  we are not injuring her ', 'it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father  at their last interview  was goading him on to propose to miss turner ', 'i have seen young mccarthy  ', 'in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex ', ' certainly  mr  holmes ', ' ah ', 'you see this other page in red ink ', 'she rose at once ', 'the bride  who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption  had sat down to breakfast with the rest  when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room ', 'as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him  and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers ', 'then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do ', ' witness  nothing definite ', ' we shall spend the night in your room  and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you  ', 'a man had waited outside the window  someone had brought the gems  the deed had been overseen by your son  he had pursued the thief  had struggled with him  they had each tugged at the coronet  their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected ', ' but his left handedness  ', 'the 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him  and what was it to them  who were playing for thousands ', 'ha ', 'singularity is almost invariably a clue ', '  no  i have not ', 'and now  watson  we shall order breakfast  and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors  commons  where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter  ', 'i had begun to take comfort too soon  however  yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father  ', 'it was useless  however ', ' i am glad of all details   remarked my friend   whether they seem to you to be relevant or not  ', 'it read in this fashion                     the red headed league                             is                          dissolved ', ' my own seal  ', 'you have formed some conclusion ', 'they each led into an empty room  dusty and cheerless  with two windows in the one and one in the other  so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them ', 'here it is that this creature takes his daily seat  cross legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap  and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him ', 'adventure iv ', 'twice she has been waylaid ', 'well  every moment now is precious  so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford

baboon ', 'i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself ', ' it is  i think  much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man  who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold ', ' here is my lens ', '  there is a drive  then  ', 'still  of course  if you would like to draw out of the business  there is plenty of time to do so  ', 'its owner is unknown ', ' she died just two years ago  and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you ', 'i may have to go down to horsham  after all  ', ' then  for god s sake  what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night  ', ' oh  mr  sherlock holmes  ', 'what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep  ', 'they are all typewritten ', ' oh  you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van ', ' to smoke   he answered ', 'there was a double stream upon the stair  some going up in hope  and some coming back dejected  but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office  ', 'holmes was for the moment as startled as i  his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation ', 'we guard our secret very jealously  however  and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house  it would soon rouse inquiry  and then  if the facts came out  it would be good bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans

blooded and reckless  ready to turn my hand at anything  i got among bad companions  took to drink  had no luck with my claim  took to the bush  and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber ', 'the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy  and  as i knew well  he was never so truly formidable as when  for days on end  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black letter editions ', 'he s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity ', ' he was in the house about half an hour  and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room  pacing up and down  talking excitedly  and waving his arms ', 'but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost ', 'his silence appears to me to cut both ways ', '  i wish you  john   said my uncle   to witness my will ', 'he overdid it ', 'it is terror  ', 'it is past ten  however  and quite time that we started ', 'it would break their hearts ', 'nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour ', ' i have them in the hollow of my hand ', 'i shall call at half past ten to morrow if i do not inconvenience you ', 'in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes ', 'then i thought of the whistle ', 'the red headed league  i had called upon my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout  florid faced  elderly gentleman with fiery red hair ', 'they come  they go  they come again  of course that was for the cloak ', ' thank you ', ' i called about that beggarman  boone  the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr  neville st  clair  of lee  ', ' how many ', 'a tall  stout official had come down the stone flagged passage  in a peaked cap and frogged jacket ', 'it was a wild night ', 'she whispered   get away from here before it is too late  ', ' and on what day did he meet his death  ', ' indeed  it is a likely ruse enough   observed bradstreet thoughtfully ', ' yes  they were peculiar boots  ', 'they say that away down in the village  and even in the distant parsonage  that cry raised the sleepers from their beds ', 'it was my coil of hair ', ' there  now  ', 'she would often be lost in deep thought  with the saddest look upon her face ', 'when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates  and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire ', 'very likely i have ', 'but  indeed  if you are trivial  i cannot blame you  for the days of the great cases are past ', ' very naturally not ', 'these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous ', 'the marks are perfectly fresh ', 'he was such a comfortable looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him ', 'and that was how a great scandal

daughter of the king of scandinavia ', 'as to what you tell me of poor mary  it goes to my very heart ', 'now  would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters  ', 'there were four of them in a row  three of which were simply dirty  while the fourth was shuttered up ', 'the adventure of the beryl coronet   holmes   said i as i stood one morning in our bow window looking down the street   here is a madman coming along ', 'someone in the next room had lit a dark lantern ', 'it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track ', 'the photograph becomes a double edged weapon now ', 'but to my astonishment  when i came to look round me  neither house nor garden were to be seen ', ' it is our task to find that out   replied holmes   so now  if you please  mr  holder  we will set off for streatham together  and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details  ', 'he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones ', ' six out and six back ', ' upon what point  ', ' in san francisco  a year ago  ', 'may we bring him in  marm  ', ' not at all ', 'but this time i was set on going  and i would go  for what right had he to prevent ', ' i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy   said holmes ', ' not yet  ', 'it had escaped my memory ', ' what on earth has that to do with it  ', 'a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite  but it was invariably locked ', 'what do you think  miss holder  ', 'a few moments later he was in our room  still puffing  still gesticulating  but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity ', 'you have really done very well indeed ', 'i am so frightened about him  ', ' i didn t know what to do  so i came straight to you  ', ' and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr ', ' and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth ', 'well  we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter  ', 'she passed down the stairs  and he  thrilling with horror  ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door  whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath ', 'so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery ', 'your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it ', '  quite so ', 'it took all my self control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment ', ' was she in good spirits  ', '6d   glass sherry  8d  ', ' not a bit  doctor ', 'i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you  ', '  oh  tut  tut ', 'besides  it is the season of forgiveness ', 'at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of  fire  ', 'it is a pure matter of form ', ' i could not bear the disgrace ', ' you are certainly joking  holmes  ', 'then he passed his handkerchief over his brow  set his lips tight  and turned his face towards us ', 'he cried impatiently ', '  you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was   and what has frightened you  my dear young lady  ', ' i had gone up to town about an investment  and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot ', 'it seems that it was ', ' 10th ', 'i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted  when he entered  to say so  but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task ', '  look in here  ', 'it is the more strange  since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea ', 'i fear that you have felt the draught  ', 'also  by the way  that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house  ', 'now  mr ', 'it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way    my dear mr  sherlock holmes   you really did it very well ', ' and the lady  i fancy  is miss stoner   observed holmes  shading his eyes ', 'i have caught you  have i ', 'i thought of the assistant s fondness for photography  and his trick of vanishing into the cellar ', 'besides  it is a useless expense  for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel  ', '  yes  but with my back towards it  ', 'i am saved  ', ' that s better  ', '  we are now   said he   actually within the hydraulic press  and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on ', ' sarasate plays at the st  james s hall this afternoon   he remarked ', 'she smiled  but there was no answering smile in holmes  thin  eager face ', 'there were thirty six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months ', 'of all these varied cases  however  i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran ', ' no ', ' what of this  cooee  ', 'you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee ', 'now for the sinister cripple

 and the evident confusion which the cripple showed  made the inspector realise that the matter was serious ', 'he curled himself up in his chair  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk like nose

clear upon the finger ', 'a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank  the modest residence of the great financier ', 'it is my belief  watson  founded upon my experience  that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside  ', 'wilson  ', 'sherlock holmes was  as i expected  lounging about his sitting room in his dressing gown  reading the agony column of the times and smoking his before breakfast pipe  which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day

he sat now as absorbed as ever  very thin  very wrinkled  bent with age  an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees  as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers ', ' all has turned out splendidly ', 'it had cleared in the morning  and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city ', 'the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open  and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture ', 'when i was alone once more  however  with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me  i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me ', 'these flat brims curled at the edge came in then ', 'you see no difficulty  heh  ', '  ah  but i sleep more heavily than you  ', 'i was shocked by the change which had come over him  for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould  was now pinched and fallen in  while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter ', 'at such times i have seen his face  even on a cold day  glisten with moisture  as though it were new raised from a basin ', 'the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london ', ' one moment   said holmes   are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound ', ' experience   said holmes  laughing ', 'i threw open the window  reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning ', 'then there was a loud and authoritative tap ', 'she left her room  therefore  and came into mine  where she sat for some time  chatting about her approaching wedding ', 'in the first place  we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america ', 'we shall now see how the electric blue dress will become you ', 'but  dear me ', 'i have been cut to the quick ', 'cried my patient ', 'surely your medical experience would tell you  watson  that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others  ', 'during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains  so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster ', 'had he appeared surprised at his own arrest  or feigned indignation at it  i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious  because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances  and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man ', '  may i ask where you live  sir  ', 'you may remember the old persian saying   there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub  and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman  ', 'after all  if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters  they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity ', ' oh  yes ', ' shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were   he remarked ', 'there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman  who seemed to be expostulating with them ', 'she has heard of you  and would have your opinion  though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done ', 'holmes nodded his head ', 'the discovery that this was a dummy  and that the bed was clamped to the floor  instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed ', 'as he said  what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church  and then leaving me ', '  sold to mr  windigate of the alpha  at 12s   ', '  you are looking for a situation  miss  ', 'i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you ', ' but what harm can there be in that  ', 'for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door

would see to anything that turned up ', 'colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles  but i should think  from the rate that we seemed to go  and from the time that we took  that it must have been nearer twelve ', '  jephro   said she   there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter  ', ' precisely ', 'her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other  noting every little want and forestalling it if possible ', 'as he ran he jerked his hands up and down  waggled his head  and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions ', ' well  at least   said holmes   you have had your revenge upon them ', 'if he is violent  we shall take you away to your aunt s at harrow ', 'i asked ', 'here is the account    between nine and ten last night police constable cook  of the h division  on duty near waterloo bridge  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water ', 'tiptoes ', 'then when you hear him retire for the night  you must open the shutters of your window  undo the hasp  put your lamp there as a signal to us  and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy ', 'my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it ', 'as to reward  my profession is its own reward  but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to  at the time which suits you best ', '  i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing   i answered ', ' it is easy for me to be so  for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory ', ' oh  then we have three days yet   said holmes with a yawn ', 'holmes rushed at the bell pull  tore back a small sliding shutter  and  plunging in his hand  pulled out a photograph and a letter ', 'this is not such a populous neighbourhood  ', 'x  the adventure of the noble bachelor  the lord st  simon marriage  and its curious termination  have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves ', 'the woman was standing in the aperture  the darkness of the hall behind her  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face ', ' with making away with mr  neville st    oh  come  you can t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it   said the inspector with a grin ', ' i shall see you at horsham  then  ', 'were scrawled upon one side ', ' dirty  ', 'it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross  holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood ', 'then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings ', 'kindly turn round and motion to him to go away  ', 'i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise  ', 'i shall look into the matter between this and then ', ' his face fell immediately ', 'we have a housekeeper now  but she is old and foolish  and i could easily get her out of the way  ', 'that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families ', '  ah  very well  then that quite settles the matter ', ' it is not cold which makes me shiver   said the woman in a low voice  changing her seat as requested ', ' yes  certainly  ', ' yes  and he seemed to think  with me  that something had happened  and that i should hear of hosmer again ', 'i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room  ', 'that is why i was so out of breath  for i am a man who takes very little exercise ', ' oh  yes  you can ', ' ah   said he   i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks ', 'i shall want your help to night  ', 'i can do nothing for myself  ', ' one more question ', ' thank you ', 'mccarthy had one son

that i ll take it  ', ' yes ', 'i asked ', ' is he not a beauty  ', ' well  you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears  for the business has not been over good for some years  and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy ', ' by jove  peterson  ', ' i think that i had better go  holmes  ', ' i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron  the walls were of wood ', 'air and scenery perfect ', ' he was a very shy man  mr  holmes ', ' i am glad to hear your majesty say so  ', ' in short  that she had become suddenly deranged  ', 'it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it ', ' i am afraid that i am still a sceptic   he said ', '  very good  ', 'then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london ', 'my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival  and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb  the groom ', ' it is no ordinary one  ', ' how did that help you  ', ' you did  doctor  but none the less you must come round to my view  for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right ', ' the man who wrote it was presumably well to do   i remarked  endeavouring to imitate my companion s processes ', 'and many men have been wrongfully hanged  ', ' lord st  simon   said he  allow me to introduce you to mr  and mrs  francis hay moulton ', 'in the scuffle  your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye ',

features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave ', 'i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face ', 'that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place ', ' where did he live  then  ', ' and your mother is alive  ', 'he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab  turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words ', 'some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall  and the stone work had been broken into  but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit ', 'my companion noiselessly closed the shutters  moved the lamp onto the table  and cast his eyes round the room ', 'male costume is nothing new to me ', 'with a boy s curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole  but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room ', ' let me see   said holmes  standing at the corner and glancing along the line   i should like just to remember the order of the houses here ', ' oh  it is a matter of no importance  but i don t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle  ', 'the lining had been of red silk  but was a good deal discoloured ', ' well  then  of course i saw it all  and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge  but he had sold the lot at once  and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone ', 'he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room  followed by the king and myself ', 'they are a most unpleasant couple  but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room  which are next to each other in one corner of the building ', ' there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table  behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine ', ' have you never    said sherlock holmes  bending forward and sinking his voice   have you never heard of the ku klux klan  ', ' now  then  mister   said he  with his head cocked and his arms akimbo   what are you driving at ', 'he has seen too much ', ' on the contrary   said holmes   it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds ', '  never  ', 'it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller s earth was the merest fabrication  for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose ', ' do you know the young lady  ', 'and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation ', 'there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar ', ' how about poison  ', ' it looks newer than the other things  ', 'at the time of the war he fought in jackson s army  and afterwards under hood  where he rose to be a colonel ', ' well  when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual  but i found that miss stoper was not alone ', ' it might have been difficult  but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know ', '  oh   said he   his name was william morris ', 'the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes  when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street ', 'i rushed forward  fell down  clapped my hand to my face  and became a piteous spectacle ', 'i gasped ', 'i traced her ', 'there was a rush  a clatter upon the stairs  the bang of a door  and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street ', 'out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered  and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming  for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy ', 'ha ', 'the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been  and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom ', '  ah  ', ' yes ', 'now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey  but the colonel answered only in monosyllables  and the conversation soon flagged ', 'of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him  and i determined to do just whatever he might direct ', ' at half wages  in fact  ', ' my dear doctor  this is a time for observation  not for talk ', ' you must make allowance for this poor girl  placed in so unprecedented a position  ', 'four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open ', 'for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face  there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect ', 'when i passed outside  however  and pressed down the levers which controlled it  i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage  which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders ', '  well  you have to be in the office  or at least in the building  the whole time ', 'a lover evidently  for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you ', ' alas  ', 'i caught a glimpse of rushing figures  and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm ', 'i have no doubt that i am myself to blame ', ' how do you know that  ', ' was your sister dressed  ', ' oh  yes  i sent him a couple of dozen  ', 'in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion  lithe and small like himself  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair ', 'how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight  and it could not be more than thirty feet down ', ' then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company   said sherlock holmes ', 'one day  however  as i ascended the stair  i met mr  rucastle coming out through this door  his keys in his hand  and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round  jovial man to whom i was accustomed ', ' but how did you gain them  ', 'still  of course  one can t refuse a lady  and such a very positive one  too ', 'let the whole incident be a sealed book  and do not allow it to affect your life  ', 'a few country carts were stirring  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis  but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream ', 'we passed across holborn  down endell street  and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market ', 'they were evidently all deserted ', 'you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard  and there are cigars in the box  ', 'they have now fled together  ', 'as i descended  my old ally  the guard  came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him ', 'for a while he could not get his words out  but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason ', 'he had nothing a few years ago ', ' who by  ', 'k ', '  tell me  helen   said she   have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night  ', 'who are you ', 'the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators  well dressed and ill  gentlemen  ostlers  and servant maids  joined in a general shriek of  fire  ', 'i ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet  ', 'ha  ha ', 'and then  seeing that i smiled and shook my head  she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward  with her hands wrung together ', 'the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze ', ' come with me  and we will see what is to be made of this fellow  ', ' i noted  in passing  that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed ', 'i thought it was his ghost at first  but when i looked again there he was still  with a kind of question in his eyes  as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him ', 'still  of course  in america they look upon these things in a different way  ', 'she was but thirty at the time of her death  and yet her hair had already begun to whiten  even as mine has  ', ' yes  only one  ', ' have they thought of looking outside the house  ', 'after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners  camp had been attacked by apache indians  and there was my frank s name among the killed ', 'i ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it  ', ' yes  ', ' precisely so ', 'i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise ', 'asked holmes ', 'it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose ', ' i should be able to look after that for you  ', ' arat   i read ', 'well  when once his case has been settled  he will have a regular prison bath  and i think  if you saw him  you would agree with me that he needed it  ', 'holmes  ', 'he hastened upstairs  and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door  which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt ', 'don t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little ', 'it is wednesday ', 'there were no signs of violence  no footmarks  no robbery  no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads ', 'on the contrary  for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood  it was remarkably animated ', ' you know my method ', 'then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad  where all traces were lost ', ' just look it up  then  ', 'my mind was soon made up ', ' you are right   he cried   i am the king ', 'never in my life have i seen such a sight ', ' you ll see your pal again presently   said jones ', 'when i had made it clear to them  i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity ', ' i should like to see him very much  ', ' nothing  until my uncle here began to speak loudly ', ' what then  ', 'i was very weak  but i have had a good deal to go through  ', '  you understand  mr  holder  that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you  founded upon all that i have heard of you ', 'she little knew what ', 'i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives ', 'there are no further particulars  and the whole case is in your hands now  so far as it has been set forth in the public press  ', 'we had driven several miles  and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas  when he shook himself  shrugged his shoulders  and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best ', 'i thought of my fifty guinea fee  of my wearisome journey  and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me ', 'i have not treated her ungenerously  and she had no just cause of complaint against me  but you know what women are  mr  holmes ', ' small  stout built  very quick in his ways  no hair on his face  though he s not short of thirty ', 'i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once  but the coachman had come in  and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait ', ' farintosh   said he ']\n"
