street a number of constables with an inspector  all on their way to their beat ', 'and now  and now i am myself a branded thief  without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character ', 'the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below ', 'asked holmes ', ' when i hear you give your reasons   i remarked   the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself  though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process ', ' it is solved  ', ' well  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better ', 'and now let us hear a true account of the next act ', 'our visitor collapsed into a chair  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow ', 'i have three maid servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion ', ' they have  however  allowed me a policeman  who may remain in the house with me  ', 'there only remains mrs  toller  who might give the alarm ', 'she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool  and that she was afraid that they were going to fight ', 'between your brandy and your bandage  i feel a new man ', ' what have you to say now  ', 'but when i gave him every particular that had occurred  he tried to bluster and took down a life preserver from the wall ', ' that is excellent ', ' nothing  ', ' what will the duke say   he murmured   when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation  ', 'however  when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others  and he closed the door as we entered  so that he might have a private word with us ', 'i heard his wife tell mrs  rucastle that she could do nothing with him  ', ' yes  ', ' but she will refuse  ', 'all day a stream of pennies  varied by silver  poured in upon me  and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take 2 pounds ', 'beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar  its silence broken only by the heavy  regular footfall of the policeman  or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers ', 'on the whole  it was most probable that the silent englishman  being less bold or less murderous than his companion  had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger ', ' then i fail to follow your majesty ', ' excellent ', ' well  let us hope so ', 'very right ', 'i was shocked by the change which had come over him  for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould  was now pinched and fallen in  while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter ', 'but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard  which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh  will answer your purpose equally well  ', 'if it had been written straight off  and then blotted

understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved ', 'the matter is a perfectly trivial one   he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat   but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction  ', 'the king stared at him in amazement ', 'you do not mean bodies  ', 'but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room  and that the clothes might betray me ', '  ah  ', 'he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night

was something terrible and deadly ', 'and  i say  doctor  there may be some little danger  so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket  ', 'he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke  and took out  to my astonishment  a very large bath sponge ', ' he seems a very amiable person   said holmes  laughing ', ' his son  you see  had grown up  and so had my girl  and as i was known to be in weak health  it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property ', ' in short  that she had become suddenly deranged  ', ' terrible ', '  why  what is it  then  ', ' here is a very fashionable epistle   i remarked as he entered ', 'how was it done  ', 'the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation ', ' that is well ', 'when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors  with the result that you have seen  ', '  come  man  come  only three minutes  or it won t be legal  ', '  i should certainly speak to the police   i said ', 'the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle ', '  some preposterous practical joke   said he ', 'i know it  and i want you to start upon your work knowing it  too ', 'in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed ', 'and on the morning of the wedding  ', 'the banker

be far off  ', 'i am somewhat of a fowl fancier  and i have seldom seen a better grown goose  ', ' d you think you know more about fowls than i  who have handled them ever since i was a nipper ', 'for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south ', 'there are grounds round it  woods on three sides  and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad  which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door ', 'to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman ', 'two years ago  having served my time  and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father s death  i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street ', 'he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son ', ' well  i guess you have every cause to be  ', ' of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang  ', 'from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter  yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us ', 'on the inside of the flap he wrote  s  h  for j ', 'besides  what use was my hair to me ', 'you say that there was a gentleman in the pew ', ' no  but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove ', ' the facts are briefly these  some five years ago  during a lengthy visit to warsaw  i made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress  irene adler ', ' yes  that is it  ', 'a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened ', 'and you have no doubt that it is your husband s hand  madam  ', '  tell me  helen   said

projecting bones ', 'what did you do  then ', 'i shall communicate with you  ', 'that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families ', '  for how long  may i ask  do you want this sum  ', 'he knew he was safe with her  but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward  who would ask for all that the law would give him  then her father thought it time to put a stop on it ', ' what can i do for you  mr ', '  you doubt its value  ', 'at that hour we shall be with you  and it will not be long before we solve the mystery  ', ' let you have five hundred to morrow morning  ', 'you have really done very well indeed ', 'then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared  and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones ', '  i am afraid that it is quite essential   said he ', 'by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade  as to the personality of the criminal  ', '  at least   said he   you will not have me arrested at once ', 'i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem ', ' i reached this one   said my friend   by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag ', 'for half an hour i sat with straining ears ', 'here is something interesting  ', ' and how in the world did you find them  ', 'i had the hint from holmes that this smooth faced pawnbroker s assistant was a formidable man  a man who might play a deep game ', 'he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred ', ' his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride ', 'mrs  rucastle is not mad ', '  ample  ', 'finally he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug ', 'wilson  ', '  it is not worth your while to wait   she went on ', 'i have already learned all that is in the public prints  nothing more ', 'there is one point which i should wish to determine  ', 'sometimes holmes would hurry on  sometimes stop dead  and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow ', ' certainly   said holmes  stepping over and turning the key in the door ', '  certainly not  ', 'with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor ', 'the lady  i think  you have already met  ', 'that second window is the one that i jumped from  ', 'just beyond it  however  at the far side of the kitchen door  a woman had stood and talked with a man  whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg ', 'well  watson  we shall see who will win in the long run ', 'still  it is clear that she is not personally threatened  ', 'may we bring him in  marm  ', ' he has his own little methods  which are  if he won t mind my saying so  just a little too theoretical and fantastic  but he has the makings of a detective in him ', 'what would he do then ', ' then that explains what the girl said  ', 'faces to the south  then  and quick march  ', 'a few moments later he was in our room  still puffing  still gesticulating  but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity ', ' do you know the young lady  ', 'he was always well dressed  very neat and plain  but his eyes were weak  just as mine are  and he wore tinted glasses against the glare  ', ' you had my note  ', 'out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light  now bright  now faint  as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes ', ' you ll have to go out  ', 'these  we presume  indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw ', 'very few governesses in england are getting 100 pounds a year ', 'however innocent he might be  he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him ', 'said holmes ', 'swiftly i threw off my clothes  pulled on those of a beggar  and put on my pigments and wig ', 'his name is armitage  percy armitage  the second son of mr  armitage  of crane water  near reading ', ' it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries ', 'i love and am loved by a better man than he ', 'it s about isa ', 'how long they seemed  those quarters ', ' one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne  and we lay in wait for it and attacked it ', '  december 22nd ', 'i used to be able to keep two assistants  but now i only keep one  and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business  ', ' how very absurd ', 'i am saved  ', 'but  you know  i have been trained as an actress myself ', ' well  ', 'every clue seems to slip through my fingers ', ' witness  i must still refuse ', ' your morning letters  if i remember right  were from a fish monger and a tide waiter  ', ' your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him  ', ' in mining ', ' i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again ', ' my photograph  ', ' that s the list of the folk from whom i buy ', 'he took off his coat and waistcoat  put on a large blue dressing gown  and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs ', 'his smile broadened ', ' when horner had been arrested  it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once  for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room ', 'he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases  and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation  ', 'suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator

up by four large staples ', 'we were as good as our word  for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches  having put up our trap at a wayside public house ', 'your life may depend upon your compliance  ', ' on the contrary   said holmes   it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds ', 'a case of identity   my dear fellow   said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street   life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent ', 'will you not wait and breakfast  ', 'he has seen too much ', ' i don t say that ', ' he has  however  retained some degree of self respect   he continued  disregarding my remonstrance ', ' what on earth has that to do with it  ', ' no  a client ', 'i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two ', 'she states that while she was there she saw  at the border of the wood and close by the lake  mr  mccarthy and his son  and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel ', 'now  watson  put your shoulder to it  and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in  ', 'i cried ', ' when did she vanish  then  ', ' and you don t know his address  ', ' no more words ', 'said holmes severely ', 'now  then   found at the corner of goodge street  a goose and a black felt hat ', 'from outside came the occasional cry of a night bird  and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine  which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty ', 'the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire  ', 'i don t think i ever drove faster  but the others were there before us ', ' experience   said holmes  laughing ', ' yes  it struck me as being a little out of the common  ', ' five attempts have been made ', ' all is lost  ', ' sir  i cannot find words to thank you  but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done ', 'said mr  rucastle  showing me a slit between two planks ', 'i shall call with the king to morrow  and with you  if you care to come with us ', ' good day  lord st  simon   said holmes  rising and bowing ', 'i sponged the wound  cleaned it  dressed it  and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages ', '  no  no  not the sole  not the sole  my dear young lady   he cried ', 'just before nine o clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room ', 'then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known  ', ' you must not fear   said he soothingly  bending forward and patting her forearm ', 'my mistress told me that you were likely to call ', 'it was the band ', 'this business at coburg square is serious  ', 'my friend smiled ', ' it is obvious ', 'altogether  look as i would  there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head  and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features ', 'a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky  and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds ', 'it is certain  therefore  that my sister was quite alone when she met her end ', ' i thought as much   said he ', 'said mr  jabez wilson ', 'to morrow i shall set to work upon your case  ', ' i ll do better ', ' farewell  then   said the old man solemnly ', 'now for the facts ', 'and the man who wrote the note is a german ', ' no  distinctly professional  ', 'a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen  questioning glances at her ', 'i invited them to meet him here  and  as you see  i made him keep the appointment  ', ' exactly so ', ' it is a noiseless lock   said he ', 'the sewing machine  of the hand type  leaves a similar mark  but only on the left arm  and on the side of it farthest from the thumb  instead of being right across the broadest part  as this was ', 'an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it  which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator ', ' hum ', 'i had not an idea who you were when you came in  ', 'for that matter  reading  and possibly other large towns  were within that radius  so the place might not be so secluded  after all ', 'julia went there at christmas two years ago  and met there a half pay major of marines  to whom she became engaged ', 'in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side ', 'he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad  ', 'he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention ', 'we must be at briony lodge to meet her  ', ' quite so  but the sequel was rather unusual ', ' precisely ', 'his hair  too  as he swept off his very curly brimmed hat  was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top ', '  oh  never mind about that  mr ', 'within there was a small corridor  which ended in a very massive iron gate ', 'kindly hand me down the letter k of the  american encyclopaedia  which stands upon the shelf beside you ', 'by eleven o clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital ', ' well  the snuff  then  and the freemasonry  ', 'it was of the same peculiar tint  and the same thickness ', 'holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen ', 'i shall certainly do as you advise  ', 'before he knew that his son had returned ', 'now  of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms ', 'irene adler  as i will still call her  had hurried up the steps  but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall  looking back into the street ', 'it was a singular sight which met our eyes ', '

correct   i answered   but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications ', '  i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own

commence with the city ', ' ah   said holmes   i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear  and that i can deduce all that remains ', ' ah yes  i recall the case  it was concerned with an opal tiara ', ' there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ', ' not at all ', 'under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested  and a verdict of  wilful murder  having been returned at the inquest on tuesday  he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross  who have referred the case to the next assizes ', ' i fancy that my pal is all right  though i see you have got his coat tails  ', 'i braved him to do his worst ', 'i roared  shaking him by the shoulder ', 'i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine  ', ' how do you know  then  ', 'i cried ', 'besides  it is the season of forgiveness ', 'the stage lost a fine actor  even as science lost an acute reasoner  when he became a specialist in crime ', 'chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem  and its solution is its own reward ', ' you are very kind  mr  holmes  but i cannot do that ', 'and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid  ', '  it is to keep people out who have no business there ', 'it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation  ', ' and what did you do then  ', 'and this ', ' if so  it is a serious case ', ' what could she mean by that note  mr  holmes ', ' and has your business been attended to in your absence  ', ' very  indeed ', 'i am all impatience to be gone  ', 'i think that was the chain of events  mr ', ' i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy   said holmes ', ' eh ', ' nothing  ', 'i will explain the state of things to you  as far as i have been able to understand it  in a very few words ', 'with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan  upon which he perched himself cross legged  with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him ', 'my dear wife knew that i had business in the city ', '  where to  ', 'said the inspector ', 'there is the first volume of it in that press ', ' he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp  but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well nurtured man ', 'the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire ', '

did you trace it  then  ', ' at the same time   he remarked after a pause  during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire   you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism  for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in  a fair proportion do not treat of crime  in its legal sense  at all ', ' the family was at one time among the richest in england  and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north  and hampshire in the west ', ' may i see it  ', 'he was a man of about fifty  tall  portly  and imposing

within assuring them that it was a false alarm ', 'in this way you see k  k  k  ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society  ', ' indeed ', ' it is a little cold for the time of the year   said holmes ', ' i went home to saxe coburg square  and i took the advice of my assistant ', 'there s twenty six of them  which makes one for you  and one for us  and two dozen for the market  ', 'they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews  and knew all about him ', 'it was not in front ', 'lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look ', ' at eight in the morning ', 'holmes grinned at the last item ', 'i slipped out  put on my things  and followed him ', 'by the time that their sailing ship reaches savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter  and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder  ', ' yes  sir  ', ' and now  mr  wilson  off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself  your household  and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes ', 'she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face ', ' you see   remarked holmes  as we paced to and fro in front of the house   this marriage rather simplifies matters ', 'k   ', 'all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective  and  for all that it was a cold night  the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road ', 'i swear it ', ' it may be so  or it may not  mr  holmes   said he   but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now  and not me ', 'the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it ', 'it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to morrow  only that this good gentleman  mr  holmes  came round to us this evening  though how he found us is more than i can think  and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right  and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret ', 'it might be a lover  it might be a husband ', 'what can i do  ', ' it is very kind of you  ', ' but to whom  ', ' it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man ', ' there can be no question as to their nature   he answered ', 'he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper  and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred ', ' the coroner  how was it  then  that he uttered it before he saw you  and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol ', 'it was quite against my wishes that she came  but she is a very excitable  impulsive girl  as you may have noticed  and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point ', 'having left lestrade at his rooms  we drove to our hotel  where we found lunch upon the table ', 'then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper  and i knew that he was writing me a note ', ' there was a little passage in front of me  unpapered and uncarpeted  which turned at a right angle at the farther end ', '  the ceremony  which was performed at st  george s  hanover square  was a very quiet one  no one being present save the father of the bride  mr  aloysius doran  the duchess of balmoral  lord backwater  lord eustace and lady clara st  simon  the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom   and lady alicia whittington ', 'still  it might be worth while to call holmes  attention to it ', ' my dear fellow  i would not miss it for anything  ', ' and miss sutherland  ', '  you are looking for a situation  miss  ', 'my dear young lady  ',

formed local branches in different parts of the country  notably in tennessee  louisiana  the carolinas  georgia  and florida ', 'as to his dress  it was careful to the verge of foppishness  with high collar  black frock coat  white waistcoat  yellow gloves  patent leather shoes  and light coloured gaiters ', ' and how have you succeeded  ', 'i have given you all the facts ', 'i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in ', 'jump up here ', 'these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat ', 'that is interesting   said holmes ', 'i threw open the window  reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning ', 'the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys  however  gave it a stricken look  as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it ', 'it was a curious way of managing it  but  really  it would be difficult to suggest a better ', ' it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been   he remarked   and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct  and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability ', 'we are faddy people  you know  faddy but kind hearted ', ' well  really  ', 'he has one positive virtue ', 'this gentleman  mr  wilson  has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases  and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also  ', 'i gasped ', ' precisely ', ' no  i do not think so ', 'in that way i didn t know much of what was going on outside  and i was always glad of a bit of news ', 'it swelled up louder and louder  a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek ', ' but i am very much mistaken if this is not

a character  ', 'giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement  and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice  little birds  and insects

with their old servants  who probably know so much of rucastle s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them ', 'now  you remark in this note of yours  mr  windibank  that in every case there is some little slurring over of the  e   and a slight defect in the tail of the  r  ', 'as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight ', 'we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years  and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures  libraries  or plate ', 'my limbs were weary and stiff  for i feared to change my position  yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension  and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions  but i could distinguish the deeper  heavier in breath of the bulky jones from the thin  sighing note of the bank director ', ' yes   he continued  glancing out of the window ', ' but you have read the evidence ', 'it is headed   singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding      the family of lord robert st  simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding ', ' if you won t tell us the bet is off  that is all ', 'well  i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category ', ' one of the highest in england  ', 'he took up the paper in a listless way  but his attention instantly became riveted  and he gave a little cry of satisfaction ', 'it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all night sitting ', 'there is that double possibility ', 'it was a delicate point  and it widened the field of my inquiry ', ' it is high  but it may be that you can jump it  ', 'as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall  which she closed and fastened as i approached ', 'you see no difficulty  heh  ', ' at half wages  in fact  ', ' you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you ', 'the building was of grey  lichen blotched stone  with a high central portion and two curving wings  like the claws of a crab  thrown out on each side ', 'it was the most preposterous position in

crime is in contemplation ', ' then  when the row broke out  i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand ', ' you will  i am sure  forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements  when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us  ', 'holmes walked slowly up and down the ill trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows ', 'there he was  sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one ', 'ah  miss  it is a pity you didn t let me know what you were planning  for i would have told you that your pains were wasted  ', 'said holmes ', ' no  my brougham is waiting  ', 'asked holmes ', 'i ll swear it on a bible ', 'his face flushed and darkened ', 'your majesty  as i understand  became entangled with this young person  wrote her some compromising letters  and is now desirous of getting those letters back  ', 'it seemed to me to be something grey in colour  a coat

strange disappearance of the bride   ', 'i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses  and received in exchange twopence  a glass of half and half  two fills of shag tobacco  and as much information as i could desire about miss adler  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested  but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to  ', 'it is in a german speaking country  in bohemia  not far from carlsbad ', 'too narrow for anyone to pass through  ', 'then  when i flash a light upon them  close in swiftly ', 'a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him ', ' this went on day after day  mr  holmes  and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week s work ', ' you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition ', 'i took the letters in in the morning  so there was no need for father to know  ', 'i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks  which i took to be the police  but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me ', 'i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room ', 'about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex  near horsham ', 'my practice is never very absorbing  ', 'our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand ', 'i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them ', 'your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it ', ' what will you do  then  ', 'must i call you a liar as well as a thief ', ' i advertised for him in last saturday s chronicle   said she ', 'he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane  where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well dressed man about town ', 'there are no further particulars  and the whole case is in your hands now  so far as it has been set forth in the public press  ', ' what have you done  ', ' i believe that he is coming here   said holmes  rubbing his hands ', ' dr ', 'as regards your hair  it is no doubt a pity  especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview  but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point  and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss ', ' quite so ', ' your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me   i observed ', 'was it possible that we could bring him back to her ', '  this is mr  jabez wilson   said my assistant   and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league  ', ' my heart had turned to lead ', 'some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall  and the stone work had been broken into  but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit ', ' yes  and i have no doubt that is her ring  ', ' here is the slip and here are four letters from him  ', ' and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards  ', 'some  too  have baffled his analytical skill  and would be  as narratives  beginnings

daughter of a california millionaire ', ' yes  sir  for he had started to england just before it arrived  ', 'with this intention  i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham  carrying the jewel with me ', 'three gone before you could wink  ', 'sir george burnwell tried to get away  but arthur caught him  and there was a struggle between them  your lad tugging at one side of the coronet

back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard  and two or three bills upon the table  i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing ', ' irene adler is married   remarked holmes ', 'he started me off upon the letter a  and then he left me  but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me ', ' i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter  ', 'then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line  and then  without any warning or sound  a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared  a white  almost womanly hand  which felt about in the centre of the little area of light ', 'besides  remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days ', 'and yet if it were on the lawn  i wonder that you did not hear it also  ', ' your presence might be invaluable  ', 'it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes  requests  for they were always so exceedingly definite  and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery ', 'it was not until close upon six o clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street  half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the d nouement of the little mystery ', 'i know that james didn t do it ', ' it missed him  then  ', ' that s it  ', ' i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room ', 'she listened for an instant  threw up her hands with a despairing gesture  and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come ', 'your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion  ', '  certainly   i answered ', 'then  with a gesture of desperation  he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground ', 'the station master laughed heartily ', 'i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table ', 'cried the inspector   you have formed your opinion ', ' awake  watson  ', 'of her i could see nothing ', 'then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure  a duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night ', '  you have called me names enough   said he   i will not stand it any longer ', 'you have been reading the papers diligently of late  have you not  ', ' will you come with me  ', 'suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage  and a long  golden bar of light shot out in our direction ', ' what  ', 'i was keenly on my guard against him ', ' see here  sir ', ' no  thank goodness  she did not  ', 'he had a garden and two or three fields round his house  and there he would take his exercise  though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room ', 'i have a professional commission for you  but absolute secrecy is quite essential  absolute secrecy  you understand  and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family  ', ' this is indeed a mystery   i remarked ', 'then i thought of the whistle ', ' precisely so  on december 22nd  just five days ago ', ' one moment   said holmes   are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound ', ' then i shall go in it ', 'would she not have made an admirable queen ', 'the devil knows best what he said  but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening  ', ' why   he shrieked   you re looking at the wrong side  ', 'both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue ', 'i have the honour to wish you a very good morning  ', ' i have had diabetes for years ', ' you see it  ', 'i don t know quite what to do  and i should value your advice ',

knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran  ', 'i took two steps forward and looked back ', 'who ', 'neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle ', 'it seems that there had been some informality about their license  that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort  and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man ', 'said he   this is treasure trove indeed ', 'it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast table and waiting for me to come back ', 'if my hair would only change colour  here s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into  ', ' always  ', 'holmes gazed long and earnestly at it ', 'i paid the man and hurried into the church ', 'perhaps  ', 'i think  watson  that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast  ', 'why ', 'i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon  ', ' yes  the wine cellar  ', ' i believe  mr  holmes  that you have already made up your mind   said miss stoner  laying her hand upon my companion s sleeve ', 'as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil  i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door ', ' to an english lawyer named norton  ', 'james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel ', ' really ', ' breckinridge is his name  ', ' your experience has been a most entertaining one   remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff ', 'you will find it here  and may read it for yourself  ', ' you would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them  ', 'he bowed  and  turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him  he set off in my company for his chambers ', 'what could be the reason of his overpowering terror ', 'there the matter stands at present  and the questions which have to be solved  what neville st  clair was doing in the opium den  what happened to him when there  where is he now  and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance  are all as far from a solution as ever ', 'but you do not yourself look upon this as likely  ', 'sherlock holmes was  as i expected  lounging about his sitting room in his dressing gown  reading the agony column of the times and smoking his before breakfast pipe  which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before

bird for life ', 'how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil ', 'one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another ', 'i was determined that the law should have its way in everything ', 'his cheeks were red  his brow was all crinkled with anger  and the veins stood out at his temples with passion ', 'lord st  simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows ', ' i hardly consider that a conclusive proof ', ' you can easily imagine  mr  holmes  how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be ', 'asked holmes ', ' thank you   said holmes   i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand  ', 'we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds ', ' on entering the house  however  i examined  as you remember  the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens  and i could at once see that someone had passed out ', ' the decline of his fortunes  then  ', 'i think it was before your time

grimesby roylott drive past  his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him ', ' witness  nothing definite ', 'i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine  not that i had any dislike to the lad  but his blood was in him  and that was enough ', ' but the gems  mr  holmes ', 'did she know where her husband was ', 'here is the account    between nine and ten last night police constable cook  of the h division  on duty near waterloo bridge  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water ', 'we got into a cab together  and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square  and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting ', ' good heavens  ', 'pray tell me in what way i can reward you ', 'a gentleman entered  with a pleasant  cultured face  high nosed and pale  with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth  and with the steady  well opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed ', ' then the page we have seen      is such as we might expect ', 'i asked ', 'probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his  who forgot all about it for some days  ', ' listen to this   you will see me when all is ready ', 'the rooms were carefully examined  and results all pointed to an abominable crime ', 'a stable boy had run out to the horse s head  and springing down  i followed

sixty  but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad  and he has been in failing health for some time ', 'he came back alone  for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town ', 'you seem most fortunate in having an employ  who comes under the full market price ', 'he slapped it down upon the table in front of him ', ' good heavens  ', 'by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood

believe  ', ' if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer ', 'he had nothing a few years ago ', ' i had a friend once called maudsley  who went to the bad  and has just been serving his time in pentonville ', 'in these cases  save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles  there is nothing which presents any features of interest ', ' this was quite too good to lose  watson ', 'very much so  ', 'here  signed with her initials  is the very note which was no

hands at once ', 'i rushed down the passage  through the door  and straight into the arms of mr  rucastle  who was waiting outside ', 'the panel had closed again behind me  but the crash of the lamp  and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal  told me how narrow had been my escape ', 'he brought up a card  too  with the name of  colonel lysander stark  engraved upon it ', ' peculiar  that is the very word   said holmes ', ' not in the least  ', ' stolen  ', ' why did you beat the pavement  ', 'we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to ', '

there might be some weapon or other trace ', 'cried my patient ', 'now the question is  where are we to find the photograph  ', 'the other clothes would have followed  but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair  and a few minutes after i found  rather  i confess  to my relief  that instead of being identified as mr  neville st  clair  i was arrested as his murderer ', 'let me see it  ', 'obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it ', 'you know what woman s instincts are ', ' because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance ', ' my name is john robinson   he answered with a sidelong glance ', 'it might or might not bite the occupant  perhaps she might escape every night for a week  but sooner or later she must fall a victim ', 'it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man  who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand

so terrible is it ', ' you heard nothing yourself last night  ', 'some letters get more worn than others  and some wear only on one side ', 'i have lost my honour  my gems  and my son in one night ',

very incomplete  ', ' i thought people would talk if i went to the hall  ', ' i have nothing to do to day ', 'but the maiden herself was most instructive  ', ' thank you   said my patient   but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me  and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure ', 'however  i threw all fears to the winds  ate a hearty supper  drove to paddington  and started

lost your fiver  for it s town bred   snapped the salesman ', 'then i walked to the other end  which was a hundred yards or more down the lane ', ' it is an ordinary plumber s smoke rocket  fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting ', 'he carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand  while he wore across the upper part of his face  extending down past the cheekbones  a black vizard

walking  ', 'he asked ', 'i wish she had been of my own station ', 'the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy backed one  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp ',

', ' you saw the ventilator  too  ', 'the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped  but was still dangerously slippery  so that there were fewer passengers than usual ', 'he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road ', 'i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool  with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side ', 'have your pistol ready in case we should need it ', 'he spoke in a jesting tone  but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me ', 'as to your practice  if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger  and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope  i must be dull  indeed  if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession  ', 'his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase  and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears  or  at the most  only provoked a quick  impatient snarl in reply ', 'the alarm of fire was admirably done ', ' if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here  ', ' i have been at some small expense over this matter  which i shall expect the bank to refund  but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique  and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red headed league  ', ' very sorry to knock you up  watson   said he   but it s the common lot this morning ', ' they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them  ', 'boots which extended halfway up his calves  and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur  completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance ', 'and there is a little reward  i fancy ', 'it was a little past six when i arrived  so i went first to have my wound dressed  and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here ', 'he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight  for he said that he hated to be conspicuous ', 'there were no signs of violence  no footmarks  no robbery  no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads ', 'now  when you see that a young lady  otherwise neatly dressed  has come away from home with odd boots  half buttoned  it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry  ', ' just one hint to you  lestrade   drawled holmes before his rival vanished   i will tell you the true solution of the matter ', ' what can it mean  ', 'he had  as it appears  been returning from fareham in the twilight  and as the country was unknown to him  and the chalk pit unfenced  the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of  death from accidental causes  ', 'the story has  i believe  been told more than once in the newspapers  but  like all such narratives  its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes  and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth ', '  i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing   i answered ', 'it must have been a very long time  for the moon had sunk  and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself ', 'i thought  however  that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration  ', 'could you swear to it  ', 'you will first make a note  doctor  of the paper and the date  ', ' pray sit down on the sofa   said holmes gently ', ' when i got back i told my maid  who had known him in california  and had always been his friend ', ' and how did you verify them  ', 'gone was the coarse brown tint ', 'with a nod he vanished into the bedroom  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable  as of old ', ' when i went down there i found him talking with his son  so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone ', 'then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones  as we may need to be at our best in the morning  ', 'mr  merryweather stopped to light a lantern  and then conducted us down a dark  earth smelling passage  and so  after opening a third door  into a huge vault or cellar  which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes ', ' excuse me   he said   but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner  ', 'she stood smiling  holding up a little slip of paper in the air ', 'does not that strike you  ', 'then suddenly he plunged forward  wrung my hand  and congratulated me warmly on my success ', 'our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking  and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face ', ' i am in hopes that she does  ', 'it was a small  office like room  with a huge ledger upon the table  and a telephone projecting from the wall ', 'the possession of a grey garment was a third point which  granting the son s statement to be correct  was a certainty ', 'it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter  and i should     his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left ', ' there is but one thing to do ', '  do you promise  then  ', ' ha ', ' no sign of it  ', 'he caught up a pen ', ' colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door  which he unlocked ', 'this would be in the year 1878  after he had been eight or nine years in england ', 'he looked from one to the other of us  as if uncertain which to address ', ' your conversation is most entertaining   said he ', ' you have an answer to everything ', 'he asked ', 'and this stone  ', 'at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low  clear whistle  but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely ', ' and you are a benefactor of the race   said i   he shrugged his shoulders ', ' well  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates ', 'the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull ', ' i will  miss turner  ', 'ha ', 'my companion sat in the front of the trap  his arms folded  his hat pulled down over his eyes  and his chin sunk upon his breast  buried in the deepest thought ', ' well  really  when i consider that she has turned her back  i will not say upon me  but upon so much that many have aspired to without success  i can hardly explain it in any other fashion  ', 'poor father has never been strong for years back  but this has broken him down completely ', 'you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me  ', 'he took a step backward  slammed the little door  and turned the key in the lock ', ' yes  certainly  ', 'that is what makes me uneasy ', '  oh  at his new offices ', 'why should i attempt to conceal it  ', ' who are you  then ', ' a thousand pounds ', 'you were chosen  doubtless  as resembling her in height  figure  and the colour of your hair ', ' for god s sake  have mercy  ', ' oh  yes  i am not joking   he continued  seeing my look of incredulity ', ' was he the only applicant  ', '  you must speak to her in the morning  or i will if you prefer it ', 'i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards ', ' you are certainly joking  holmes  ', ' the first thing that put us out was that advertisement ', 'she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered  and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street ', 'holmes shook his head gravely ', 'ha ', ' now  if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure  ', 'your husband  as far as you could see  had his ordinary clothes on  ', 'i found sherlock holmes alone  however  half asleep  with his long  thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair ', 'he wouldn t have any visitors if he could help it  and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle ', 'it is too late  forever too late ', 'i bought this estate  which chanced to be in the market  and i set myself to do a little good with my money  to make up for the way in which i had earned it ', 'this we have now been doing for some time  and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press ', ' i shall try not to miss anything of importance ', ' just see how it glints and sparkles ', 'behind there was nothing remarkable  save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house ', 'get out of this  ', 'still  of course  in america they look upon these things in a different way  ', 'the initials were  of course  of the highest importance  but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels  ', ' i fished about with a rake ', 'but to day being saturday rather complicates matters ', ' what i cannot understand   said i   is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden ', ' yes  ', ' 10th ', 'it was my coil of hair ', 'said he ', 'we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound  and then a scream of agony  with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to ', 'i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman  ', ' but this maid  alice  as i understand  deposes that she went to her room  covered her bride s dress with a long ulster  put on a bonnet  and went out  ', ' the lady could not move her bed ', ' that s better  ', 'for the rest  there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note books bearing upon my uncle s life in america ', 'as to what you tell me of poor mary  it goes to my very heart ', 'the will is very clear upon that point ', ' well  watson   said holmes when our visitor had left us   what do you make of it all  ', 'holmes chuckled heartily ', 'those are the crucial points upon which the case depends ', ' it s only carlo  my mastiff ', 'we both put our eyes to the grating ', ' by no means  ', 'she smiled  but there was no answering smile in holmes  thin  eager face ', ' it was very sweet of you to come ', ' in your heart of hearts  do you think that neville is alive  ', 'on the other hand  he had no means of supporting himself  and his father  who was by all accounts a very hard man  would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth ', ' oh  yes  mother is alive and well ', ' that is back through the house into saxe coburg square ', 'she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet ', ' it was lost  if i remember aright  at the hotel cosmopolitan   i remarked ', ' you are right   said holmes demurely   you do find it very hard to tackle the facts  ', ' we never thought that she would have been so carried away  ', 'leave paddington by the 11 15  ', ' indeed ', 'but if it were the maids  why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place ', '  as governess  ', 'yet when i spoke to her of the matter  she answered me abruptly  and in the carriage  on our way home  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause  ', 'at three o clock precisely i was at baker street  but holmes had not yet returned ', ' the church of st  monica   said i   and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes  ', 'my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister

hullo ', 'but how to get to him in safety ', ' no  no  he found it ', ' but not more so than i to find you  ', 'you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle  which appeared to be a mere whim at first  developed into a serious investigation ', ' they considered that it might be caused by arthur s closing his bedroom door  ', ' you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me   i remarked ', '  precisely so ', 'it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength ', ' as a rule   said holmes   the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be ', 'you know peterson  the commissionaire  ', ' then my servant will call a cab  and i shall be with you in an instant  ', 'let the weight of the matter rest upon me now  and do not let your mind dwell upon it further ', 'holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house  across the front  down the tradesmen s path  and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane ', ' i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past  ', 'who were these german people  and what were they doing living in this strange  out of the way place ', 'i shall take your advice in every particular  ', 'asked sherlock holmes  with his finger tips together and his eyes to the ceiling ', '  lord robert walsingham de vere st  simon  second

colonies in a late administration ', 'and yet there was but one woman to him  and that woman was the late irene adler  of dubious and questionable memory ', ' besides  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr  lestrade ', ' i told you that i would call  ', 'if so  how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself ', ' holmes   i cried   i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at ', ' your majesty must pay ', 'large sitting room on the right side  well furnished  with long windows almost to the floor  and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open ', ' and where is it  ', ' and on what day did he meet his death  ', '  what are you doing there  ', '  then  good night  ', 'we may take it  then  that she does not carry it about with her  ', 'i didn t know what to do ', 'i called in the inspector and gave him into custody ', 'the events in question occurred in the early days of my association

a careful examination of the attic  which had been always locked up ', 'if he braved the matter out  death would unfailingly come upon him  and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner ', '  never   said i ', 'a groan of disappointment came up from below  and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager ', 'i returned the strange hair to the drawer  and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked ', 'a month ago

had he ever spoken of swandam lane  ', '4th  rooms 8s   breakfast 2s ', 'but never mind that ', 'i confess that i was disappointed ', ' i thought it as well   said holmes as we climbed the stile

assistance ', 'from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages  it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation  ', ' in which  sir  ', ' i started off  mr  holmes  but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps  and no one in it had ever heard of either mr  william morris or mr  duncan ross  ', 'cried holmes   the deadliest snake in india ', 'as i was already in debt to my tradesmen  the advance was a great convenience  and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself ', ' to do nothing whatever ', 'mr  st  clair is now thirty seven years of age  is a man of temperate habits  a good husband  a very affectionate father  and a man who is popular with all who know him ', 'easier the other way  perhaps  and yet  had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me ', ' i took it

suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience ', ' but you can know nothing of this  ', ' it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible  whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth ', 'with a stout bearing  therefore  though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess  i still shook my head and

on my hat and cloak  went down to the office  which is about half a mile from the house  and then returned  feeling very much easier ', 'a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to

the knees as he walked ', ' i did not know ', ' you will remember that i remarked the other day  just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland  that for strange

you  i d rather have that one i was handling just now  ', 'what do you deduce from it  ', 'my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty ', 'as i glanced at the box i noticed  with a start  that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope ', 'he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown  a pipe rack within his reach

error ', ' i am surprised that lord st  simon has not already arrived ', ' what  ', 'then he turned to me  tapped his forehead three times  shook his head solemnly  and hurried away ', 'my clothes were all sodden with dew  and my coat sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb ', ' yes  ', 'lestrade looked startled ', 'he was a lawyer ', 'it is perhaps the best possible solution ', 'but our trap should be here  ', 'holder   said he   i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money  ', 'if she had  it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely ', ' the gas was half up  as i had left it  and my unhappy boy  dressed only in his shirt and trousers  was standing beside the light  holding the coronet in his hands ', 'it was after five o clock when sherlock holmes left me  but i had no time to be lonely  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner s man with a very large flat box ', ' well  to tell the truth  i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp ', 'i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter s words  and say   there  but for the grace of god  goes sherlock holmes   ', 'i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours  but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes ', 'then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe  which was to him as a counsellor  and  having lit it  he leaned back in his chair  with the thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him  and a look of infinite languor in his face ', 'there must be some strong reason behind  ', 'of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim ', 'here we are  and they are waiting for us  ', ' oh  yes  i sent him a couple of dozen  ', 'whose  then  ', 'but i have heard  mr  holmes  that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart ', ' it is a question of cubic capacity   said he   a man with so large a brain must have something in it  ', ' a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties ', 'he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note paper ', ' i could hardly imagine a more damning case   i remarked ', 'there cannot be any missing   said he ', '6d   ', ' did you observe the colour  ', 'i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter  for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public ', 'vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up  but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing ', 'is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic  that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum  and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak  ', 'you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them ', ' my name is helen stoner  and i am living with my stepfather  who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england  the roylotts of stoke moran  on the western border of surrey  ', 'i thought of my fifty guinea fee  of my wearisome journey  and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me ', ' i owe you an apology   he said  raising his golden pince nez to his eyes ', ' no doubt you think me mad  ', 'together we rushed into the room ', ' ah ', 'what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was ', ' it is so long a chain  and yet every link rings true  ', 'what do you mean  ', 'it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money  and that it is still lying in our cellar ', ' i can quite understand your thinking so   i said ', 'about sunset  however  their efforts were at last successful  and they subdued the flames  but not before the roof had fallen in  and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that  save some twisted cylinders and iron piping  not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly ', 'there s two of us  me and my son  and you can have the keeping of us ', ' oh  mr  sherlock holmes  ', 'holmes whistled ', 'i must compliment you  ', 'i will read it to you  and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter ', 'in a word  i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past ', 'it s a wicked world  and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all ', ' they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently ', 'mr  windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother  and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting ', ' and  indeed  i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him  for he has frequently brought him to my house  and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner ', 'as it was  he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man ', 'you will find parallel cases  if you consult my index  in andover in  77  and there was something of the sort at the hague last year ', 'i say it is south  for the country is more deserted there  ', 'find what i owe  watson ', 'he took a large villa  laid out the grounds very nicely  and lived generally in good style ', 'there was a movement and an exclamation from my right  and peering through the gloom  i saw whitney  pale  haggard  and unkempt  staring out at me ', 'he spoke calmly  but i could see that he was deeply moved ', 'his eyes sparkled  and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette ', 'i found my father expiring upon the ground  with his head terribly injured ', 'fowler  ', ' oh  you may carry that feeling away with you ', 'sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion  but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor ', 'a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs ', 'remarked holmes ', ' pon my word  it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to  for my own thoughts are not over pleasant ', 'we must come back to that ', 'his footmarks had pressed right through the snow  so long had he stood there ', ' by all means  ', 'well  there is nothing very instructive in all this ', 'when i cried out that it was a false alarm  she replaced it  glanced at the rocket  rushed from the room  and i have not seen her since ', ' it is possible  ', ' we have been on a friendly footing for some years  i may say on a very friendly footing ', 'it seemed funny that i should ask his leave  as he was only a few years older than me  but i didn t want to do anything on the sly  so i wrote to father at bordeaux  where the company has its french offices  but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding  ', ' i shall glance into the case for you   said holmes  rising   and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result ', 'suddenly  to my surprise  the three at the altar faced round to me  and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me ', 'now  would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters  ', ' i have just been there  and i have taken it out  and i have got it in this gladstone bag ', 'you need not  however  go to the expense of purchasing one  as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice  now in philadelphia   which would  i should think  fit you very well ', ' eh ', 'he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday school treat ', 'he followed me to my room  however  that night with a very grave face ', ' thank you ', 'in the latter  as may be remembered  sherlock holmes was able  by winding up the dead man s watch  to prove that it had been wound up two hours before  and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time  a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case ', ' oh  certainly  if it would give you any pleasure  ', ' is it possible  ', 'he had foresight  but has less now than formerly  pointing to a moral retrogression  which  when taken with the decline of his fortunes  seems to indicate some evil influence  probably drink  at work upon him ', 'your own opinion is  then  that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him  ', 'in two hours we must be on the scene of action ', 'his dress was rich with a richness which would  in england  be looked upon as akin to bad taste ', 'you have no further evidence  i suppose  than that which you have placed before us  no suggestive detail which might help us  ', 'sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids ', 'when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of  cooee  ', ' then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it  ', 'he answered that the name was new to him ', 'our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him  and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs ', ' it is so very kind of you both  but indeed i do not know what i should do ', 'yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit  and due to no disease  for his eye was bright  his step brisk  and his bearing assured ', ' i really wouldn t miss your case for the world ', 'ryder instantly gave the alarm  and horner was arrested the same evening  but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms ', ' you are hungry   i remarked ', 'well  mrs  st  clair  the clouds lighten  though i should not venture to say that the danger is over  ', 'the point is  have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady ', 'they have now fled together  ', ' it means that it is all over   holmes answered ', ' you see  watson   he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street   it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league  and the copying of the  encyclopaedia   must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day ', 'we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate  and a short walk took us to saxe coburg square  the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning ', '  yes  i promise  ', ' perhaps you had better not speak of the matter ', 'i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast ', ' i would give my fortune to have them back  ', 'this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens ', ' and your father ', 'the whole garden has already been minutely examined  ', 'well  when once his case has been settled  he will have a regular prison bath  and i think  if you saw him  you would agree with me that he needed it  ', 'then suddenly realising the exposure  he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow ', 'i know him from the photograph  ', ' it is half past ten now  ', 'it is a hereditary matter  so in order to give you an idea of the facts  i must go back to the commencement of the affair ', 'i leave my estate  with all its advantages and all its disadvantages  to my brother  your father  whence it will  no doubt  descend to you ', ' there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table  behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine ', ' i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge ', 'however that may be  the young lady was very decidedly carried away  and  having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind ', 'i was already deeply interested in his inquiry  for  though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded  still  the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own ', 'that is how he did it  ', 'at the church door  however  they separated  he driving back to the temple  and she to her own house ', ' i have heard of you  mr  holmes ', 'i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot  for the cabs go slowly through this snow ', 'he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard  sandwiched it between two rounds of bread  and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition ', ' i ve got him here   he whispered  jerking his thumb over his shoulder   he s all right  ', 'he is one of the most dangerous men in england  a ruined gambler  an absolutely desperate villain  a man without heart or conscience ', 'as i descended  my old ally  the guard  came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him ', ' how on earth      my dear fellow  i know you well ', 'as you may observe  mr  holmes  my hair is somewhat luxuriant  and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut ', '  you have been very kind   said he   but i must have this money  or else i can never show my face inside the club again  ', 'an eley s no ', 'in the meantime mr  merryweather  we must put the screen over that dark lantern  ', 'and  who did you sell the geese to  ', ' we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it  ', ' how do you know that  ', 'but how      was there a secret marriage  ', ' which were very well justified   observed holmes ', 'he never spoke of the softer passions  save with a gibe and a sneer ', 'there would be one to reading in less than an hour ', ' precisely ', ' but the mystery  ', 'he said a few words to each candidate as he came up  and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them ', ' ah  yes ', '  very good  ', 'i asked  for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room ', '  yes  jem  there were two barred tailed ones  and i could never tell them apart  ', ' no  ', 'he cried ', 'if not  i should much prefer to communicate with you alone  ', ' as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage  and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher s cleaver in the other ', ' he ', 'there s plenty of thread  no doubt  but i can t get the end of it into my hand ', ' yesterday  ', ' well  some hundreds of times  ', ' yes  sir  but very quietly ', '  and how far from the edge of the wood  ', 'there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman  who seemed to be expostulating with them ', 'god help me ', ' then pray send him home in it ', ' in the cells  ', ' i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands   remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists ', ' 9th ', ' i am a practical man   he said   and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left handed gentleman with a game leg ', ' i came to find a friend  ', 'mr  and mrs  rucastle were both downstairs  and the child was with them  so that i had an admirable opportunity ', 'said he carelessly   we have our own process ', ' no  but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more ', ' it is fear  mr  holmes ', 'i would not have missed it for worlds ', 'oh  how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it ', 'the question now was  who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet ', 'the same porter was on duty  i found  as had been there when i arrived ', 'fairbank was a good sized square house of white stone  standing back a little from the road ', 'one of the gold corners  with three of the beryls in it  was missing ', 'if i could only bring you down all would be well ', ' you are to watch me  for i will be visible to you  ', ' the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places ', 'in the first place  we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america ', 'he shook hands with us and took his leave ', ' the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder  the game keeper  lost sight of them ', ' your narrative promises to be a most interesting one  ', 'i dropped my gun and held him in my arms  but he almost instantly expired ', 'holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and  leaning back with his hands in his pockets  began talking  rather to himself  as it seemed  than to us ', 'it is the vilest murder trap on the whole riverside  and i fear that neville st  clair has entered it never to leave it more ', ' entirely  ', ' and your father  ', 'a touch of red in nose and cheeks  with a slight tremor of his extended hand  recalled holmes  surmise as to his habits ', ' mr  henry baker  i believe   said he  rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume ', ' quite so ', 'had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me ', ' you will excuse my beginning without you  watson   said he   but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning  ', 'i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were  but they were made of frosted glass  and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light ', 'twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk  and yet mr  rucastle seemed to take no notice of it ', ' i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories ', 'he was a large man with rounded shoulders  a massive head  and a broad  intelligent face  sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown ', 'the marks are perfectly fresh ', 'perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook ', ' i did at first   she answered   but now i know where the letters are without looking  ', ' from east london ', 'the bride  who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption  had sat down to breakfast with the rest  when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room ', 'she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead  and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs ', 'i nodded to show that i had heard ', ' miss roylott  you have not ', 'as a rule  when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events  i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory ', ' a

holmes  i am a very stay at home man  and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it  i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat ', 'we could write in the meantime  and he used to write every day ', 'sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture  however  for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door ', 'for an hour or more he was at work  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever ', 'when i have spun the web they may take the flies  but not before  ', ' we must have a cab  ', ' what s up  then  ', ' they must have done so ', 'you will leave the papers here  and remember the advice which i have given you ', ' not in a good cause  ', ' pray continue your very interesting statement  ', ' i cannot see that there is anything very funny   cried our client  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head ', 'and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes ', 'over the edge there peeped a clean cut  boyish face  which looked keenly about it  and then  with a hand on either side of the aperture  drew itself shoulder high and waist high  until one knee rested upon the edge ', 'my stepdaughter has been here ', 'i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning  or what i ended by doing  ', 'it was a poky  little  shabby genteel place  where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure  where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial atmosphere ', 'he asked ', 'this woman might  for all i knew  be a monomaniac ', ' it is his hat  ', ' tell me   broke in the engineer   is dr  becher a german  very thin  with a long  sharp nose  ', ' it makes you quite invaluable as a companion ', 'a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems  but no trace of them could be found  nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats ', ' i did as he ordered  and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room ', 'you will sign it  and watson here can witness it ', 'it hadn t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it ', ' then it was not arthur who took them  ', ' he is  in my judgment  the fourth smartest man in london  and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third ', 'he drew up the windows on either side  tapped on the wood work  and away we went as fast as the horse could go  ', 'ix ', 'so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway  and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side ', 'it is true that you have missed everything of importance  but you have hit upon the method  and you have a quick eye for colour ', 'a frenchman or russian could not have written that ', ' this is a very unexpected turn of affairs   said i   and what then  ', ' yes  but only for you and me  ', 'not even your skill can inform me where she is now  ', '  and he is admirably suited for it   the other answered ', 'a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end  ', '  no  i forbid you ', ' i assured him that i was not offended ', 'hosmer  mr  angel  was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street  and      what office  ', 'something like fear sprang up in the young lady s expressive black eyes ', 'i hadn t been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road ', 'we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in ', ' why serious  ', ' now  watson   said holmes  as a tall dog cart dashed up through the gloom  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns ', 'this case  i presume  contains the coronet ', 'putting his hands into his pockets  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes ', 'impossible  ', ' by the way  i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now ', ' it was clamped to the floor ', ' but if i am to go  i must pack at once  for i have only half an hour  ', 'i slipped out of bed  all palpitating with fear  and peeped round the corner of my dressing room door ', 'i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me ', ' to the police  ', 'he was very willing to have a holiday  so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement ', 'this is my intimate friend and associate  dr  watson  before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ', ' i shall be delighted  ', 'however  in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow  so i bought a penny bottle of ink  and with a quill pen  and seven sheets of foolscap paper  i started off for pope s court ', ' he is still with you  i presume  ', 'during two years i have had three consultations and one small job  and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me ', ' there are one or two very singular points about this room ', ' through the skylight ', 'i walked round the corner  saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend s premises  and felt that i had solved my problem ', ' but we can t all be  ', 'he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park ', 'he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands ', 'but what was she to do ', 'and here is the very note  ', 'at least that was my first impression ', ' oh  no  no ', 'his manner was not effusive ', 'dr  grimesby roylott s chamber was larger than that of his step daughter  but was as plainly furnished ', 'he waved his hands  ', '  yes  it was gone  ', 'she is four and twenty  ', ' then we had a talk as to what we should do  and frank was all for openness  but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again  just sending a line to pa  perhaps  to show him that i was alive ', 'and no more words were needed ', 'as far as i can make out  the league was founded by an american millionaire  ezekiah hopkins  who was very peculiar in his ways ', ' i then lounged down the street and found  as i expected  that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden ', '  do you desire your name to be kept upon the books  ', 'i smiled and shook my head ', 'i asked ', 'he asked ', ' the  lone star  had arrived here last week ', 'twice she has been waylaid ', 'oh  heaven bless you  ', 'you seem to have done the thing very completely ', 'it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london ', ' then i will  ', 'i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket  and i thought that  as we were a partie carr e  you might have your rubber after all ', 'i saw no one near my father when i returned  and i have no idea how he came by his injuries ', 'now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey  but the colonel answered only in monosyllables  and the conversation soon flagged ', ' what s in here  ', 'as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others ', ' you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins ', ' now  mr  holder   said holmes   here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost ', 'do you not deduce something from that  ', ' i bowed  feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address ', ' oh  he has his faults  too   said mr  wilson ', ' it is the purest accident ', 'the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those all night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in  when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a test tube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning ', 'he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady  so i offered to typewrite them  like he did his  but he wouldn t have that  for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me  but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us ', 'the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest  fighting against his emotion ', ' witness  he mumbled a few words  but i could only catch some allusion to a rat ', 'he is the green grocer who brings our vegetables round ', 'man  or at least criminal man  has lost all enterprise and originality ', 'your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me ', 'i have never denied him a wish ', 'the pipe was still between his lips  the smoke still curled upward  and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze  but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night ', 'it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots ', ' the leader of the gang ', ' he s a brave fellow   said a woman ', 'you find it so  ', 'then with a red head of hair  and an appropriate dress  i took my station in the business part of the city  ostensibly as a match seller but really as a beggar ', 'i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted  when he entered  to say so  but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task ', 'it laid an egg after it was dead  the bonniest  brightest little blue egg that ever was seen ', ' that is better   said john clay serenely ', 'i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed ', 'holmes stooped to the water jug  moistened his sponge  and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner s face ', ' i think that we may safely say   returned holmes   that she is wherever sir george burnwell is ', 'i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare  ', 'now  look at that third name ', '  but   said i   there would be millions of red headed men who would apply  ', 'i have not come to stay   said i ', ' he investigated the case with great care  for dr  roylott s conduct had long been notorious in the county  but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death ', ' if i can be of use  ', 'out there fell a cascade of children s bricks ', 'now carry out my orders to the letter  ', 'it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west ', '  on the contrary   said i   i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close  ', ' it was only yesterday that the chance came ', ' well  you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint  laying my cap on the ground  and sitting still ', 'i don t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement  ', ' it is not an english paper at all ', ' it was not the wife  it was the children   groaned the prisoner ', 'i am the last court of appeal  ', 'there can be no question that it was your oil lamp which  when it was crushed in the press  set fire to the wooden walls  though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time ', ' the coroner  i am afraid that i must press it ', ' this is the girl s stepfather  mr  james windibank   said holmes ', 'as we entered he made neither sound nor motion ', ' why did you come to me   he cried   and  above all  why did you not come at once  ', 'f h m  ', 'on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast table ', ' you really are very fine indeed ', 'when he told us of a man in a pew  of the change in the bride s manner  of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet  of her resort to her confidential maid  and of her very significant allusion to claim jumping  which in miners  parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to  the whole situation became absolutely clear ', 'he is small for his age  with a head which is quite disproportionately large ', 'then  as to sitting here or there  or amusing yourself in any manner indicated  that need cause you no inconvenience ', ' yes  sir  that is undoubtedly my hat  ', 'the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked ', ' we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you ', ' yes  it was only put there a couple of years ago  ', 'there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner  a scissors grinder with his wheel  two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl  and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths ', ' it appeared in all the papers about a year ago ', ' you will tell me if you have any news to morrow ', ' and so do i  it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day ', 'the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough ', 'i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that  though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other  they were really odd ones  the one having a slightly decorated toe cap  and the other a plain one ', ' this aroused my curiosity  so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge  i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house ', 'there it is in a nutshell ', 'i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him  ', ' is briony lodge  serpentine avenue  st  john s wood  ', ' i am no official agent ', 'i paced up and down the room  humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty guinea fee ', 'in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser ', ' you did not overhear what they said  ', 'then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st  simon alone  and so we came right away round to his rooms at once ', 'i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again  where i was soon asleep ', ' what ', 'now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it ', ' pray compose yourself  sir   said holmes   and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you  ', ' the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing ship ', 'they are

meant for the son ', 'we should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den ', '  why that  ', 'there has been no result  ', ' you may rely upon my doing all that i can  ', ' and have you any on hand just now  ', 'i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference ', 'who do you give your casting vote to  ', 'light a cigar and let me expound  ', ' still  i confess that i miss my rubber ', 'pray continue your most interesting statement  ', 'clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind ', ' then you don t think i ll see him again  ', 'holmes rushed at the bell pull  tore back a small sliding shutter  and  plunging in his hand  pulled out a photograph and a letter ', 'it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison  ', 'let us now see the letter ', ' well  but china  ', 'you see  watson  our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect ', 'it will end in my being conveyed into the house ', 'i asked ', 'the double line a little above the wrist  where the typewritist presses against the table  was beautifully defined ', ' i shall expect you  then  at eyford at 11 15  ', ' a house on fire  ', 'the furniture was scattered about in every direction  with dismantled shelves and open drawers  as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight

that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye ', 'there could be no doubt that  as it was a national possession  a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it ', 'even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience ', 'i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs  rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze ', 'it was early in april in the year  83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing  fully dressed  by the side of my bed ', 'that is what mr  lestrade  of scotland yard  looks upon as so serious ', ' well  it is not for me to judge you   said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out ', 'that is important  ', ' the name of the maker  no doubt  or his monogram  rather  ', 'come  ', ' so it is   he cried ', ' and what of irene adler  ', 'his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural  having a black top hat  a long frock coat  and a pair of high gaiters  with a hunting crop swinging in his hand ', 'she cried in english   remember your promise after the last time ', ' well  i have only just heard the facts  but my mind is made up  ', 'i confess that the guilt of the banker s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father  but still i had such faith in holmes  judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation ', ' now  my dear sir   said holmes   is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think ', ' but you are joking ', ' then  as to money  ', 'i don t know  ', ' it s a common enough lash ', ' because he was handy and would come cheap  ', 'as he spoke he drew the dog whip swiftly from the dead man s lap  and throwing the noose round the reptile s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and  carrying it at arm s length  threw it into the iron safe  which he closed upon it ', 'i came in by train this morning  and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor  a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here ', '  dearest do not be frightened ', 'as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not  but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to ', 'with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him ', 'but the deception could not be kept up forever ', 'we heard the door open  a few hurried words  and then quick steps upon the linoleum ', 'a double carriage sweep  with a snow clad lawn  stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance ', ' yes  it would be as well  ', ' my dear holmes   said i   this is too much ', ' no  but this horrible man confessed to having been there  and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs  ', ' yes  it is all we can do to make him wash his hands  and his face is as black as a tinker s ', 'i dine at seven ', 'they spoke of those hours of burrowing ', 'it seemed altogether past belief

think of leaving   said i ', ' and who could it be who was her confederate ', 'i could tell you tales of cobbler s wax which would disgust you with human nature  ', 'there was one singular exception  however  for he had a single room  a lumber room up among the attics  which was invariably locked  and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter ', ' on monday  ', ' not particularly  ', 'it was twenty five minutes to twelve  and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind ', 'cried lestrade with some bitterness ', 'it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler ', 'it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention ', 'i am prepared to leave it with you as my security  ', 'it was late before sherlock holmes returned ', ' where to  ', 'holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement ', 'asked holmes ', 'it is not so impossible  however  that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work  and this i have endeavoured in my case to do ', ' but your client      never mind him ', 'so far i had got before i ever heard lord st  simon s narrative ', ' do you know  watson   said he   that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject ', ' there is a well known agency for governesses in the west end called westaway s  and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me ', 'then he became a little more reasonable ', '  we are now   said he   actually within the hydraulic press  and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on ', ' i told you yesterday  and i repeat to day  that it was not  ', ' oh  then we have three days yet   said holmes with a yawn ', 'i stood firm ', 'let me explain ', ' i hear that it was during the night  sir  but it has got worse  and the whole place is in a blaze  ', '  in my own bureau  ', 'there was one wing  however  which appeared not to be inhabited at all ', ' no  i must go ', 'i was ten miles or so from eyford  that was all i knew  but whether north  south  east  or west i had no idea ', 'they all appear to be adhesive  and there is a distinct odour of lime cream ', ' why did you pick him  ', 'nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour ', 'public disgrace i might have faced  although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain ', ' this  i take it  belongs to the room in which you used to sleep  the centre one to your sister s  and the one next to the main building to dr  roylott s chamber  ', ' i do not quite follow   he said ', 'i was preoccupied with business matters  ', ' your french gold  ', ' you could not possibly have come at a better time  my dear watson   he said cordially ', 'it is unthinkable  ', 'it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father  at their last interview  was goading him on to propose to miss turner ', 'pray proceed  ', ' what then  ', 'he asked ', 'are you satisfied  ', 'this stone is not yet twenty years old ', 'said he ', 'i have no one to turn to  none  save only one  who cares for me  and he  poor fellow  can be of little aid ', 'i ll serve you  ', 'that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown ', ' there is a train at half past nine   said i  glancing over my bradshaw ', 'he was still  as ever  deeply attracted by the study of crime  and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues  and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police ', 'it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess  but as i have changed my clothes i can t imagine how you deduce it ', 'our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal  for the table had not been cleared yet ', ' how could i help suspecting him  when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand  ', 'it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted ', ' i was afraid that you were engaged  ', ' no  i shall be my own police ', 'i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london  ', 'he would not go to the police  and he would not go to you  and so at last  as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done  it made me mad  and i just on with my things and came right away to you  ', 'we have known each other since we were little children  and i know his faults as no one else does  but he is too tender hearted to hurt a fly ', ' we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work   said the inspector ', ' there is a little nut for you to crack  master holmes  ', ' a little french  a little german  music  and drawing       tut  tut  ', 'i have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds ', ' yes ', 'he asked ', ' there are thirty nine enormous beryls   said he   and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable ', 'her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty  but her hair was shot with premature grey  and her expression was weary and haggard ', ' if your majesty would condescend to state your case   he remarked   i should be better able to advise you  ', 'good day to you  miss hunter  ', 'i know i ought to have spoken to lord st  simon  but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people ', 'such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him  ', ' it s a new patient   he whispered ', '  absolute and complete silence before  during  and after ', 'it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart ', 'mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet  but i thought it better not to disturb it ', 'in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr  grimesby roylott s death  and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience  ', 'the ring  after all  proves nothing ', ' oh  the cause is excellent  ', 'and into her sitting room  which was the very room which i suspected ', 'has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window  ', 'and now i will make the thing clear to you  it has been a long time in the acting  but will not take me long to tell ', 'mccarthy had one son  a lad of eighteen  and turner had an only daughter of the same age  but neither of them had wives living ', ' yes  it must be so ', ' i searched the dundee records  and when i found that the barque  lone star  was there in january   85  my suspicion became a certainty ', 'i had  as you know  cut off my hair in london  and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk ', ' what do you read  ', 'i looked at it before   said lestrade ', ' what is it  then  a fire  ', 'as it pulled up  one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper  but was elbowed away by another loafer  who had rushed up with the same intention ', 'and i poured out some water from a caraffe ', 'a maid rushed across and threw open the window ', ' i found her more interesting than her little problem  which  by the way  is rather a trite one ', ' i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for  ', 'i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn 700 pounds a year  which is less than my average takings  but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up  and also in a facility of repartee  which improved by practice and made me quite a

streatham since i saw you last  but i did not call at the house ', ' why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry  ', 'many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number ', 'i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless  inexorable evil  which no foresight and no precautions can guard against  ', ' because she has said that she would send it on the day when

ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting room ', 'you then     ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion s knees ', 'and now let us talk about george meredith  if you please  and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow  ', 'asked holmes  yawning ', 'what could that something be ', 'you look at these scattered houses  and you are impressed by their beauty ', ' their reasons for their conduct ', 'it was no wonder that no one was stirring ', 'it read in this fashion                     the red headed league

know me  then  ', ' there   said he  putting a new wedding ring upon the top of the pile ', ' oh  yes ', 'i answer  because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle s life  and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another ', ' i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine   he remarked  and bowing in a stately  old fashioned manner he departed ', 'i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it  but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears  and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose bushes ',

station master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire ', 'cried holmes with enthusiasm ', ' there is one other thing you owe  mr  holder   said sherlock

shoes  i found myself inside the bedroom ', 'but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me ', 'sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning  dipping continuously into the

', 'to do this  we must try the simplest means first  and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers ', ' there s a cold blooded scoundrel  ', ' it is to him that this trophy

experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties  ', 'as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper ', 'he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before  and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him ', ' none save my partner

not a clean one  so i deduced a blunt pen knife  ', ' well  then  ask mrs  oakshott for it  ', ' you will excuse me   said holmes blandly   but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now ', 'i shall be all anxiety  ', 'thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr  neville st  clair  with the exception of his coat ', ' and brought

my eyes caught the glint of a light ', 'a few yards off he stopped under a lamp post and laughed in the hearty  noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him ', 'i leave it with you  however  with every confidence  and i shall call for it in person on monday morning  ', 'what has she been saying to you  ', ' so i have heard  ', 'in fact  in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a

thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones  both before and after ', 'the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel ',

'ah  watson  you have just come at the right time ', 'he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves ', 'but a human body is a different matter ', ' yes  i rather think he is coming to consult me

throw  and will  at the same time  raise the cry of fire ', ' yes  ', 'she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry ', 'it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl  how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow  of how the slow process of

only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us ', 'he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral

a furniture warehouse  of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque  sophy anderson   of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa  and finally of the camberwell poisoning case ', ' in this sinister way i came into my inheritance ', 'the copper beeches  five miles on the far side of winchester ', '  that is very awkward ', 'i thought it was wednesday ', ' my cabby drove fast ', 'she is even more affected than i  ', 'a fierce quarrel broke out  which was increased by the two guardsmen  who took sides with one of the loungers  and by the scissors grinder  who was equally hot upon the other side ', 'they are not very exacting  after all ', 'what could it be ', 'are you sure that everything is fastened  ', 'she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way  with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned ', 'he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies  and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble covered land which represent the family estate  and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents  wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end ', 'ha  ha  my boy  what do you make of that  ', 'at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other  while a number of better dressed people  who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it  crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man ', 'in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue  i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h  moulton  an american gentleman  had left only the day before  and on looking over the entries against him  i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill ', '

the outskirts of lee   said my companion ', ' but he ll be gone before you can get him to hospital  ', 'then the charge against him will break down  ', 'how came the stone into the goose  and how came the goose into the open market ', ' hum  ', 'it is evidently trying to your nerves  ', 'i thought of the assistant s fondness for photography  and his trick of vanishing into the cellar ', 'you heard him yourselves to night ', 'he opened his bag as he spoke  and tumbled onto the floor a wedding dress of watered silk  a pair of white satin shoes and a bride s wreath and veil  all discoloured and soaked in water ', ' no  no   cried holmes  shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen ', 'the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also  from his point of view  be an advantage ', ' the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you  and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own  ', ' how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell ', 'that is his main fault  but on the whole he s a good worker ', 'then i walked across to the window  hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country side  but an oak shutter  heavily barred  was folded across it ', 'of these  one  the  lone star   instantly attracted my attention  since  although it was reported as having cleared from london  the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union  ', ' what becomes  then  of these nocturnal whistles  and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman  ', 'how very impertinent ', 'what was he doing there at all ', ' witness  i should prefer not to answer ', ' it was most suggestive   said holmes ', 'then mr  angel began to call  for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced ', 'let us glance at our continental gazetteer  ', ' it was in january   85  that my poor father met his end  and two years and eight months have elapsed since then ', ' i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments  but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them ', '  well   said he  showing me the advertisement

photograph becomes a double edged weapon now ', 'who would have ever believed it  ', ' and the ring  ', ' on the contrary   said holmes quietly   i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr  hosmer angel  ', 'has only one male visitor  but a good deal of him ', 'he moved out yesterday  ', '  well  it is of no great consequence  at any rate  ', ' anyhow  i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of   replied lestrade with some warmth ', ' and what did you see  ', 'he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look ', 'but there is  if you will excuse my saying so  something just a little funny about it ', 'a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead ', 'it had ceased ere i was wide awake  but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere ', 'holmes nodded his head ', ' you will excuse this mask   continued our strange visitor ', ' certainly  ', ' i was sure that i might rely on you  ', ' oh  certainly  certainly   answered mr  baker with a sigh of relief ', 'before seeing him ', ' there is serious news this morning   lestrade observed ', ' holmes   i cried   you are too late  ', 'now we can talk in safety  ', 'when i see you  my dear watson  with a week s accumulation of dust upon your hat  and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state  i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife s affection  ', 'i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind  for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill natured a little creature ', 'holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady  but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground  with the blood running freely down his face ', 'he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through ', 'she asked  facing round to me ', 'the passage outside was empty ', ' it is  i think  much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man  who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold ', ' very strange  ', 'its disappearance  however  was but momentary ', ' i must go home now  for dad is very ill  and he misses me so if i leave him ', ' then he might have called to you  ', ' then i must begin   said he   by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years  at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance ', 'asked sherlock holmes  leaning back in his chair ', 'heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double breasted coat  while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl ', 'i sent john  the coachman  to watch you  ran up stairs  got into my walking clothes  as i call them  and came down just as you departed ', 'i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative  but  on the contrary  he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention ', 'and then suddenly the whole business came to an end  ', 'and  above all  take care of yourself in the meanwhile  for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger ', 'it may  however  have been written on monday and only posted to day  ', 'in the last century  however  four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition  and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency ', 'all this is amusing  though rather elementary  but i must go back to business  watson ', ' good heavens  ', 'it was in the summer of  89  not long after my marriage  that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise ', 'but i saw nothing ', ' will you go  ', ' if you can catch the man  catch him  and let me know when you have done it  ', 'why  watson  let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them ', ' it might have been difficult  but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know ', 'until after the alarm of fire  i had not a suspicion ', 'apply in person on monday  at eleven o clock  to duncan ross  at the offices of the league  7 pope s court

literature of the subject ', 'i fainted dead away  and i was very sick for months after ', ' it looks newer than the other things  ', 'here it is  and you can read for yourself  ', 'to me it has been exceptionally so ', ' i was staggered  sir ', 'the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there  ready to flash out at a moment s notice ', 'she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom ', ' let me see  ', ' i am not quite so bulky  but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own  ', ' let us have everything in its due order  ', ' see that you keep yourself out of my grip   he snarled  and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room ', 'without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage  the door of which was standing open ', 'to me  with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy  there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom  and in the cold dank air of the vault ', ' watson  i think you know mr  jones  of scotland yard ', ' here  ', 'holmes turned to his desk and  unlocking it  drew out a small case book  which he consulted ', '  it is locked up   i answered ', ' and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side ', 'she is herself the very soul of delicacy ', ' so much so   i remarked   that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes  three have been entirely free of any legal crime  ', 'but soon he found that that would not answer forever ', ' you horrify me  ', 'i went about  however  with a heart which was full of forebodings ', ' when he was gone i unlocked my bureau  made sure that my treasure was safe  and locked it again ', 'there is only one point on which i must insist ', ' quite so ', 'the instant that we heard it  holmes sprang from the bed  struck a match  and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell pull ', 'holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness  such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced ', 'in spite of its youth  it has already a sinister history ', 'our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors  quarter  wimpole street  harley street  and so through wigmore street into oxford street ', 'yet when i think of him in cold blood  far away from the glamour of his presence  i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted ', ' you may address me as the count von kramm  a bohemian nobleman ', 'hum ', 'this may save us a visit to brixton road   whispered holmes ', 'then i looked in upon your son  told him that all was right  and eventually got to my bed about two o clock  after what i may call a really hard day s work  ', ' the coroner  what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel ', ' it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived  ', 'not more than is usual in my family  ', 'disregarding my presence  she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress ', ' farintosh   said he ', 'but now  thanks to this lucky chance  i think that we have got them right enough  ', ' there has been some villainy here   said holmes   this beauty

with you in money matters  ', '  pon my word  watson  you are coming along wonderfully ', 'but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over  for goodness  sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful  ', 'but i am now sleeping in the middle one  ', 'cried i   if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved  i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  before you go to the official police  ', 'the bridge  no doubt  was too crowded  even on such a night  for their purpose ', 'i ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet  ', ' i make nothing of it   i answered frankly ', 'the only drawback is that there is no law  i fear  that can touch the scoundrel

in his hands  ', '  oh  no  ', 'now  let me just run over the course of events  and you will contradict me if i go wrong  ', 'we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible  and out into the bright morning sunshine ', 'i cried half mad with grief and rage ', ' oh  yes  easily  ', 'it was a quarter past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park  and so through oxford street to

day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you  ', 'then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london ', 'he snatched it from her in his eagerness  and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently ', 'what an exposure ',

crackling voice ', 'tottering and shaking in all his giant frame  he stumbled slowly from the room ', 'i laid the two tresses together  and i assure you that they were identical ', ' why shouldn t we

of his shoulders ', 'the road topped a low hill  and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us  spouting fire at every chink and window  while in the garden in front three fire engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under ', ' a little too much so ', '  i am sure if i had known       well  then  you know now ', 'his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man  or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness ', ' oh  so so ', ' well  to come to an end of the matter  mr  holmes  and not to abuse your patience  there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back ', 'a hundred and fifty guineas apiece ', ' we were both in the photograph  ', 'on the contrary  for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood  it was remarkably animated ', 'i asked ', ' certainly ', 'there are several people in the neighbourhood  however  and among them miss turner  the daughter of the neighbouring

should be eaten without unnecessary delay ', ' we both thought the best resource was flight  when pursued by so formidable an antagonist  so you will find the nest empty when you call to morrow ', 'he tossed a crumpled letter across to me ', ' warm ', ' yes  i shall not feel easy until i have told my story  ', '  no  i cannot  ', 'it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers  ', ' the warning was no idle one  for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o clock in the morning ', 'said he   i ve let them go at six hundred for the three  ', 'i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be ', 'the night  however  was extremely dark and stormy  so that  in spite of the help of several passers by  it was quite impossible to effect a rescue ', 'you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle  and

the consulting room ', 'a twitch brought away the tangled red hair  and there  sitting up in his bed  was a pale  sad faced  refined looking man  black haired and smooth skinned  rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment ', ' i cannot imagine  ', 'in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me  and also in the arnsworth castle business ', '  you are

not wish a smarter assistant  mr  holmes  and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him ', 'never in my life have i seen such a sight ', ' i should be able to look after that for you  ', ' it must be recovered  ', 'it brings me twopence a sheet  and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day  ', ' married ', ' but the money  mr  holmes  the money  ', 'rather than i should marry another woman  there are no lengths to which she would not go  none  ', 'all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness  gently

failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house ', 'still  it did not go for very much  for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell ', 'said he ', 'she struck a gong upon the table  and i was shown out by the page ', 'it is introspective  and i want to introspect ', 'sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform  his tall  gaunt figure made even

', 'had she seen someone  then ', 'as he reached the corner of goodge street  a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs ', 'as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses

very angry indeed  and i have been shamefully used  ', ' and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study  mr  windibank   holmes continued ', 'as he ran he jerked his hands up and down

to approach him  and instantly  as he turned his face half round to the company once more  subsided into a doddering  loose lipped senility ', ' you ll come with me  won t you  ', 'she cried  glancing from one to the other of us  and finally  with a woman s quick intuition  fastening upon my companion   i am so glad that you have come ', ' then  pray consult   said holmes  shutting his eyes once more ', 'at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history  ', 'she left this morning with her husband by the 5 15 train from charing cross for the continent  ', ' pray continue your narrative  ', ' it is a swamp adder  ', 'but here   i picked up the morning paper from the ground   let us put it to a practical test ', ' surely ', 'then he

would convulse the nation ', ' it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter   i remarked with some coldness  for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to

that she had passed some time ago  and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight  ', 'it was the toy which he had promised to bring home ', 'was she his client  his friend  or his mistress ', 'but  cooee  is a distinctly australian cry  and one which is used between australians ', 'have you your check book ', 'and now  miss

cellar on some errand  and then turn the key upon her  you would facilitate matters immensely  ', 'said she ', 'it was in the latter days of september  and the equinoctial gales had set in with

my heart  and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster ', 'you must get home instantly and act  ', ' this is wanting in the police report  where more stress is laid  perhaps  upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details  which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter ', 'had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester  i should never have had a fear for her ', ' for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet  on the third  mrs  rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband ',

parallel cuts ', 'these are daring men  and though we shall take them at a disadvantage  they may do us some harm unless we are careful ', 'gasped the banker ', 'from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous  hesitating fashion at our windows  while her body oscillated backward and forward  and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons ', ' i am afraid the doctor won t allow it  ', 'for a long time he remained there  turning over the leaves and dried sticks  gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach ', 'just read it out to me  ', 'one evening  after the child was in bed  i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things ', 'you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart  and that the two may have planned the robbery  ', ' then  how do you know  ', 'the walls were carefully sounded  and were shown to be quite solid all round  and the flooring was also thoroughly examined  with the same result ', 'he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best  with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed ', ' precisely so ', '  precisely  ', ' the coroner  what did you understand by that ', ' to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned ', 'i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion ', 'it was a long fight between my pride and the money  but the dollars won at last  and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen  inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers ',

there is some building going on there   said holmes   that is where we are going  ', 'let us follow it out to the bitter end ', 'i am sure  mr  holmes  that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up ', 'said he ', ' not in the least ', 'as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years  and as lord st  simon

there are seventeen steps  because i have both seen and observed ', ' most certainly it does ', 'a lean  ferret like man  furtive and sly looking  was waiting for us upon the platform ', 'far from

mother take the matter  ', ' certainly  ', 'i followed them up and found they led to the hall window  where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting ', ' but what is it you wish  ', 'he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea ', 'i call him father  though it sounds funny  too  for he is only five years and two months older than myself  ', 'the matter passed  however

your son s guilt  ', ' then i have just time  with your assistance  to get clear upon the subject ', 'i asked  smiling ', 'i should like  however  to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do  ', 'here s half a crown ', 'it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it ', ' very good  lestrade   said holmes  laughing ', 'but then  when i found how i had betrayed myself  i began to think ', 'a series of disgraceful brawls took place  two of which ended in the police court  until at last he became the terror of the village  and the folks would fly at his approach  for he is a man of immense strength  and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger ', ' thank you ', ' yes  sir ', ' but how could you guess what the motive was  ', 'you have come up from the south west  i see  ', 'i never went wrong before ', 'you say so ', ' she was angry  and said that i was never to speak of the matter again  ', 'some woman came talking something or other about lord st  simon to me  seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also  but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank ', 'he mumbled several words  you understand  but that was all that caught the son s ear ', 'every day  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon  i waited in my little den  until at last my heart began to sink  and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all ', ' at what time  ', 'as he spoke there was a tap at the door  and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland  while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full sailed merchant man behind a tiny pilot boat ', 'we got away with the gold  became wealthy men  and made our way over to england without being suspected ', ' mrs  oakshott  117  brixton road  249   read holmes ', 'he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room  followed by the king and myself ', 'when these hot fits were over  however  he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him  like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul ', ' it is  i am afraid  not very encouraging to his supporters  though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive ', 'it is a very sweet little problem  and i would not have missed it for a good deal ', 'that is just my point ', 'as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning  and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character  with immense capacity for self restraint ', 'take your pistol  and we will enter dr  roylott s room  ', ' you have a grand gift of silence  watson   said he ', 'in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt ', 'the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare  but i jumped in before he could object ', 'he advanced slowly into the room  turning his head from left to right  and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses ', 'the summons was a brief and urgent one ', 'with hardly a word spoken  but with a kindly eye  he waved me to an armchair  threw across his case of cigars  and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner ', 'i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair ', 'there was the point from which all my adventures started ', ' how did you deduce the select  ', ' you ll see your pal again presently   said jones ', 'set the pips on mccauley  paramore  and       john swain  of st  augustine ', 'left his lodgings at ten o clock at night  and has not been heard of since ', 'ha ', 'oh  do not waste the so precious time  but come  ', 'then she got better at last  all worn to a shadow  and with her beautiful hair cut off  but that didn t make no change in her young man  and he stuck to her as true as man could be  ', 'there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor  while the plaster was peeling off the walls  and the damp was breaking through in green  unhealthy blotches ', 'more than once i have surprised her in tears ', 'in life or in death  i am ever your loving   mary  ', 'with a rending  tearing sound  one of the broad  white stones turned over upon its side and left a square  gaping hole  through which streamed the light of a lantern ', '  yes  sir  ', ' i see  her ladyship s waiting maid ', ' she brought  i understand  a considerable dowry  ', ' let me see   said holmes  standing at the corner and glancing along the line   i should like just to remember the order of the houses here ', ' i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr  john clay   said holmes ', 'as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room ', 'he had set the engine at work ', 'there was the case  and of course there was but one way out of it ', 'can you suggest no explanation  ', 'ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine  ', ' it is nothing very formidable   he said  taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket ', ' oh  yes  i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went  but i was kind of rattled  and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn t know what i was doing or saying ', 'replied our visitor   the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague  and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points  which might seem trivial to another  that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman ', 'there is ever a flaw  however  in the best laid of human plans  and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another  as cunning and as resolute as themselves  was upon their track ', 'with that he seized my hair in both his hands  and tugged until i yelled with the pain ', ' you have but to name it  ', ' yes  from horsham  ', ' i have a cab outside  ', ' of course  in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled  throughout three continents  you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre ', 'you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described ', ' it was a singular document ', '  oh  just as you like   said she  a little huffed ', 'he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear  with my hands on the testament  that whatever happened i would always be true to him ', '  how far from the body  ', 'so much is fairly clear ', 'the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door  pushing his way past her  but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back ', 'some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper  so that it flew upon the first person it saw ', 'therefore he used a holder ', 'holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it  but without result ', 'the one unpleasant thing about the house  which struck me at once  was the appearance and conduct of the servants ', ' oh  if you say so  mr  jones  it is all right   said the stranger with deference ', 'the place we want must be somewhere near that line ', 'i know that all is well with him ', 'we were engaged to each other  frank and i  but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile  while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing ', ' really  now  ', 'that carries us right on to the other block ', ' what ', 'i had just finished my tea when he returned  evidently in excellent spirits  swinging an old elastic sided boot in his hand ', 'upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major  imploring me to come at once ', ' the case has been an interesting one   remarked holmes when our visitors had left us   because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable ', 'i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me  ', 'i have been at work upon it all day  ', ' oh  yes  i did ', ' the glass still keeps very high   he remarked as he sat down ', ' i suppose  watson   said he   that you imagine that i have added opium smoking to cocaine injections  and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views  ', 'with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way ', ' pshaw ', 'i believe that that is the village inn over there  ', 'with trembling hands i undid my trunk  turned out the contents  and drew from the bottom my own hair ', 'you may safely trust him  for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief ', 'he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket  all covered with dates and names ', 'i should be compelled to stop the night  ', ' oh  yes ', ' and the papers  ', 'there are several other indications  but these may be enough to aid us in our search  ', 'when  in addition  i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch chain  the matter becomes even more simple  ', 'holmes  ', ' no  his friend ', 'he has a passion also for indian animals  which are sent over to him by a correspondent  and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon  which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master ', ' i am going right on  ', ' i know where it is  ', 'fleet street was choked with red headed folk  and pope s court looked like a coster s orange barrow ', ' it s as well   said the old man   it s a question whether i shall live to the assizes  so it matters little to me  but i should wish to spare alice the shock ', 'miss doran  whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities  is an only child  and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures  with expectancies for the future ', 'but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it  it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly  which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature ', 'there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house ', 'on returning  he found that horner had disappeared  that the bureau had been forced open  and that the small morocco casket in which  as it afterwards transpired  the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel  was lying empty upon the dressing table ', 'ah  me ', 'next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake  and by the day after i was sure of it ', '  you may as well face the matter   said i   you have been caught in the act  and no confession could make your guilt more heinous ', 'sometimes i think that i am myself ', ' the coroner  i understand that the cry of  cooee  was a common signal between you and your father ', 'i dressed hurriedly  for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial  and hastened downstairs ', ' it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business  ', 'his features were gravely set  but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions ', 'the manor house is  as i have already said  very old  and only one wing is now inhabited ', 'getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter  after all ', ' that is the reward  and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem  ', '  i wish you  john   said my uncle   to witness my will ', 'i am going out now  ', 'i have no doubt that she loved you  but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves  and i think that she must have been one ', 'the adventure of the beryl coronet   holmes   said i as i stood one morning in our bow window looking down the street   here is a madman coming along ', 'i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms

exceedingly interesting case it appears to be ', 'he picked a red covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece ', ' yes  i saw it by the side lights when i was stepping into the carriage ', 'if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you  you would not object to our little whim ', 'on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches  mr  rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door ', ' ballarat  ', 'said holmes  looking keenly at her ', 'it was more a feeling of duty  a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place ', 'there was a moment s delay  but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again  and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall ', 'the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor  the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings ', ' no  it is not even attached to a wire ', 'among these he rummaged and read  with intervals of note taking and of meditation  until we were past reading ', ' i must really ask you to be a little more quiet  ', 'a precious stone ', 'drink this  ', ' what do you make of that  watson  ', ' what  ', ' just look it up  then  ', 'if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger      danger ', 'once we diverted her luggage when she travelled ', '  from dundee   i answered  glancing at the postmark ', ' but i am so sure that

it up to the light  ', 'but why  ', 'i ve had one or two little turns also with mr  john clay  and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession ', 'he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way ', 'from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor ', 'i m sure i beg pardon ', 'in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are  to the best of my belief  unique  ', 'i have caught you  have i ', ' ah  of course ', 'if the former  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping ', 'now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age ', 'i was at my wit s end where to get the money  but a sudden idea came to me ', ' what has she been saying to you  ', 'i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results ', ' we shall spend the night in your room  and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you  ', ' the matter is too serious for any hesitation ', ' none at all ', 'i have a confused memory  too  of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere  ', 'adventure ii ', 'he drank more than ever  and he was less inclined for any sort of society ', 'your advice will be altogether invaluable to me  ', 'there are not many in london which charge at that rate ', ' good heavens  ', 'i rushed out  calling loudly for my stepfather  and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown ', 'he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb  but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes  sunk in the deepest thought ', 'there was the huge famished brute  its black muzzle buried in rucastle s throat  while he writhed and screamed upon the ground ', ' but his wife  you said that she had ceased to love him  ', ' on the contrary  this is the right side  ', 'and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar  a woman who is now in custody  and who had already made a disturbance at mr  doran s house that morning  ', 'yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol  ', ' well  he is sure to keep an eye on the papers  since  to a poor man  the loss was a heavy one ', '  where are they all

same time as the bell rope  ', 'but look at these lonely houses  each in its own fields  filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law ', '  not so many as you might think   he answered ', 'it was the bisulphate of baryta  ', 'he was doing something in the cellar  something which took many hours a day for months on end ', 'i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars ', ' what is it  ', 'don t you see that the converse is equally valid ', 'a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious ', 'if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter ', 'when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club  and there  having charming manners  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits ', ' my dear holmes  ', ' it has been a case of considerable interest   he remarked  returning to his natural manner ', 'my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk pits which abound in the neighbourhood  and was lying senseless  with a shattered skull ', 'i began to laugh at this  but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face ', '  and not a word to a soul  ', ' what do you make of that  ', 'data ', 'i have traced her ', 'i ve had enough of it ', 'at the time of the war he fought in jackson s army  and afterwards under hood  where he rose to be a colonel ', 'private affliction also is the lot of every man  but the two coming together  and in so frightful a form  have been enough to shake my very soul ', '  my dear young lady ', 'besides  there were no marks of any violence upon her  ', '  it is also my custom   said he  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face   to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand  so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe  ', ' nous verrons   answered holmes calmly ', 'it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected ', 'our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement ', 'you don t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time  ', 'visited paramore ', 'he looked her over in his searching fashion  and then composed himself  with his lids drooping and his finger tips together  to listen to her story ', 'there were several people on the pavement at the time  but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by ', 'look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining ', 'come in  ', ' none at all   said holmes ', 'what do you think  miss holder  ', 'the presence of the gipsies  and the use of the word  band   which was used by the poor girl  no doubt  to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match  were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent ', 'if you find you cannot  take my advice  my boy  and leave it to your deadliest enemy ', 'i went and saw him ', 'i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them  ', ' my dear doctor  this is a time for observation  not for talk ', 'there was a double stream upon the stair  some going up in hope  and some coming back dejected  but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office  ', 'toller  for that is his name  is a rough  uncouth man  with grizzled hair and whiskers  and a perpetual smell of drink ', ' and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet   cried mr  holder ', 'and now let us consider another point ', 'how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould  which told us a very plain tale ', ' i am naturally observant  as you may have remarked  mr  holmes  and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head ', 'he said that he had never heard of any such body ', 'i ll take you round to him myself  ', ' well   he said   i say now  as i said then  that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use  and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his library  where he can get it if he wants it ', 'd you see ', ' why ', 'did i buy the geese off you  ', ' yes  sir ', 'now from this double point our research must commence  and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true  ', ' i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain ', 'on the other hand  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me  and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller s earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight  and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand ', 'the red headed league  i had called upon my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout  florid faced  elderly gentleman with fiery red hair ', 'she has the face of the most beautiful of women  and the mind of the most resolute of men ', ' both you and the coroner have been at some pains   said he   to single out the very strongest points in the young man s favour ', ' precisely  ', 'you said ten miles  i think  sir  ', 'our own door flew open  and a lady  clad in some dark coloured stuff  with a black veil  entered the room ', 'i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing  but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring  or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man ', ' yes ', 'there is not  and there never has been  any such person  ', ' his hand when he wrote hurriedly ', ' you have been cruelly used   said holmes ', ' and the lady  i fancy  is miss stoner   observed holmes  shading his eyes ', 'i am not over tender of heart  but i call it cruel  ', ' i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation  ', 'he was in a pitiable state of reaction  with every nerve in a twitter ', 'tiptoes ', 'read it  ', ' all right   said jones with a stare and a snigger ', 'a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows  for my father was a man of a very violent temper ', 'asked this apparition ', ' the further points  that he is middle aged  that his hair is grizzled  that it has been recently cut  and that he uses lime cream  are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining ', 'yet  with all this  you made me reveal what you wanted to know ', ' that is unusual in a young girl  ', 'i hope that i may be back in a few hours  ', ' which is it you want  then  ', 'two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building  and my bedroom wall has been pierced  so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died  and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept ', 'when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love ', ' when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the  pink  un  protruding out of his pocket  you can always draw him by a bet   said he ', 'sherlock holmes had not come back yet ', ' what is it  then  ', 'i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over ', 'it seems that it was ', ' oh  indeed ', 'we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door ', ' oh  well  he was very good about it ', 'and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this  ', 'the trap drove on  and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting rooms ', 'it was not merely that holmes changed his costume ', 'in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself  and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented  as i have often thought  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him ', ' not at all ', ' you have no chance at all  ', 'my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning ', 'xii ', 'it was useless  however ', 'oh ', 'now  i ll state the case clearly and concisely to you  watson  and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me  ', 'born in 1846  ', ' and yet i question  sir  whether  in all your experience  you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family  ', 'several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point  but he always glided away to some other topic  until at last i gave it over in despair ', 'it is just possible  however  that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation ', ' so i see   the other answered with the utmost coolness ', 'the next instant i threw myself through  and lay half fainting upon the other side ', 'i am afraid that i am a little late  but i am not quite my own master  you know ', ' incredible imbecility  ', 'the facts are these  about four o clock on christmas morning  peterson  who  as you know  is a very honest fellow  was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road ', ' the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller s earth  which  as i understand  is dug out like gravel from a pit  ', 'it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side ', ' smart fellow  that   observed holmes as we walked away ', 'see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant ', 'one of these  whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease  was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence ', 'john horner  26  plumber  was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst   abstracted from the jewel case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle ', '  if you please  miss stoper  ', ' you are sure of it ', 'i shall drop you a line before i leave  ', 'i had no idea that he was in front of me ', 'i read for about ten minutes  beginning in the heart of a chapter  and then suddenly  in the middle of a sentence  he ordered me to cease and to change my dress ', 'why  all the morning he was saying to me that  whatever happened  i was to be true  and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us  i was always to remember that i was pledged to him  and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later ', 'i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet  and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived ', ' you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks ', 'there were meetings  and an engagement  which would finally secure the girl s affections from turning towards anyone else ', 'he rushes to some secret hoard  where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary  and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat s sinking ', 'we even traced them as far as reading  but could get no farther  for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands ', ' had there been women in the house  i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue ', 'i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held  1000 pounds apiece ', ' but what  then  did the gipsies do  ', ' without  however  the knowledge of pre existing cases which serves me so well ', 'it was not mere curiosity  though i have my share of that ', 'i ask you now  is such a theory tenable  ', 'you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger  but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink ', 'capital ', 'and what do you think they found in the pockets  ', 'i thought it as well to have jones with us also ', 'some of the general public were present  then  ', 'hudson came ', 'i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me ', 'my sister asked me what was the matter  and why i was so pale  but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel ', ' no crime  but a very great error has been committed   said holmes ', 'he asked  tapping the safe ', 'perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up  ', ' and now you must on no account lose another instant ', ' ay  bodies  watson ', ' god help me  ', ' and yet   said i  smiling   i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records  ', 'cried the inspector   it is  indeed  the missing man ', ' one other question   said he ', 'i answered ', ' i will tell you  then  what occurred in your house last night ', ' come in  ', 'as you observe  this woman had plush upon her sleeves  which is a most useful material for showing traces ', ' indeed ', 'her prolonged absence having caused some comment  her father followed her  but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant  caught up an ulster and bonnet  and hurried down to the passage ', 'i dashed some brandy into the water  and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks ', 'it corresponds with the injuries ', ' indeed  your example is an unfortunate one for your argument   said holmes  taking the paper and glancing his eye down it ', ' it is our french gold   whispered the director ', 'he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab  turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words ', 'i was the only passenger who got out there  and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern ', 'says she ', 'you are in my power ', 'the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat encircled eyes ', 'we can t command our love  but we can our actions ', ' kindly look her up in my index  doctor   murmured holmes without opening his eyes ', 'the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table ', 'she asked ', 'i thought that it must be when i saw the door open  ', 'i think that the change would do you good  and you are always so interested in mr  sherlock holmes  cases  ', 'it is your commonplace  featureless crimes which are really puzzling  just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify ', ' with the result of driving it through the ventilator  ', 'might i not escort her to this place ', ' six out and six back ', 'he calls attention  and with reason  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him  also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father  and his singular account of his father s dying words ', ' why  i have lost four pound a week  ', 'while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events  we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind  and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us ', 'holmes drove in silence  with his head sunk upon his breast  and the air of a man who is lost in thought  while i sat beside him  curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely  and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts ', 'here we are ', 'suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st  clair through the window  there is no human eye which could have seen the deed ', 'let me out  ', 'holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock ', 'i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible  but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady  even though i disregarded them  and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ', 'my friend tore it open and we all three read it together ', 'he curled himself up in his chair  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk like nose  and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird ', 'the machine goes readily enough  but there is some stiffness in the working of it  and it has lost a little of its force ', 'early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people

my waistcoat pocket ', 'finally  i went to the landlord  who is an accountant living on the ground floor  and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red headed league ', 'lestrade

great anxiety ', 'what did she do on re entering her father s house  ', 'inspector barton  who had charge of the case  made a very careful examination of the premises  but without finding anything

raise the bar ', ' oh  it won t do  really it won t   said holmes suavely ', 'his grandfather was a royal duke  and he himself has been to eton and oxford ', 'they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives  though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood ', 'he cried  and

neck  and a large curling red feather in a broad brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear ', 'my friend rose now and paced up and down the room  his hands in his pockets  and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face ', 'he was a middle sized man  coarsely clad as became his calling  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent

no marks  ', 'he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it ', 'they were admirable things for the observer  excellent for drawing the veil from men s motives and actions ', 'then he

', ' perhaps  mrs  moulton  you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter  ', 'i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him ', 'it was the

the glade ', ' the vanishing of the lady  ', 'at the foot of the stairs  however  she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken  who thrust her back and  aided by a dane  who acts as assistant

den  and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened  ', 'then  suddenly springing to his feet  he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room ', ' well  moonshine is a brighter thing than fog   said holmes  laughing ', 'he yelled ', ' i am mr  holmes   answered my companion  looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze ', 'in this case  however  they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man  ', 'he is not a very

something else to think of  ', ' the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left ', 'i rushed upstairs  explained the matter shortly to my wife  and in five minutes was inside

and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion  ', 'it must  then  be something out of the house ', 'besides  she is not so very young ', 'i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client ', 'there can be no doubt that the probability  the strong probability  is that the writer was on board of a ship ', 'it is most important  all the same ', 'he led us down a passage  opened a barred door  passed down a winding stair  and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side ', 'i was a young chap then  hot

all that miss hunter has to tell  ', ' someone has loosed the dog ', 'i asked   the same as the one i chose  ', ' after all  watson   said holmes  reaching up his hand for his clay pipe   i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies ', 'i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view  but without noting anything else of interest ', ' to tell the truth   he sank his face into his thin  white hands   i have felt helpless ', 'said he  with something of a german accent ', ' of course ', '  why  i wonder at that  for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies  ', ' missing   it said   on the morning of the fourteenth  a gentleman named hosmer angel ', 'this man  however  was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up ', '  then  good bye  mr  jabez wilson  and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain  ', ' thank you  mrs  st  clair ', 'he asked with his eyes open ', 'there are windows in it  of course  ', ' i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client ', 'i ejaculated ', 'then they will not lose a minute  for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape ', 'we called at the door  when the maid  at holmes  request  showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death  and also a pair of the son s  though not the pair which he had then had ', ' threatens to send them the photograph ', ' my face lengthened at this  mr  holmes  for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all  but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right ', 'perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right  ', ' pending the alterations  as i understand ', 'so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered  and had almost come to believe that mrs  st  clair had been deluded when  with a cry  she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it ', 'ha ', 'for seven hours i plied my trade  and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26s ', ' i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning   i remarked ', ' it is k  k  k    said i ', 'i shall be busy this afternoon  and shall probably return to london by the evening train  ', ' so much for the servants ', 'then the fact that the two men were never together  but that the one always appeared when the other was away  was suggestive ', ' a patient  ', 'james and his father had many disagreements about me ', 'it is possible  however  that i may have something better before very many minutes are over  for this is one of my clients  or i am much mistaken  ', 'i must wire to the king without delay  ', ' the first was from pondicherry  the second from dundee  and the third from london  ', 'i want to see whether the objections are fatal  or if they may be explained away ', 'then  again  i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red  or dark red  or anything but real bright  blazing  fiery red ', ' well  now  in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy s narrative which struck us both instantly  although they impressed me in his favour and you against him ', 'i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room  ', 'i asked ', 'the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny ', ' i say it is  ', ' i won t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that  especially as  rather against the strict rules of your order  you use an arc and compass breastpin  ', ' this is a map of the colony of victoria   he said ', ' i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph  ', ' that is easily got  ', 'i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs  ', 'mary was the first to rush into my room  and  at the sight of the coronet and of arthur s face  she read the whole story and  with a scream  fell down senseless on the ground ', ' i ve had enough of you and your geese   he shouted ', 'we shall then look thoroughly into the affair ', 'and what conclusions did the coroner come to  ', 'the walls were of wood  but the floor consisted of a large iron trough  and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it ', ' now  i wonder who the deuce that could have been  ', 'then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one  that it would be at st  george s  hanover square  that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited  and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr  aloysius doran ', ' i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder ', 'this note i had this morning marks my zero point  i fancy ', 'in each case  not only are the  e s  slurred and the  r s  tailless  but you will observe  if you care to use my magnifying lens  that the fourteen other

better ', 'he gasped ', ' still  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters ', 'suddenly  amid all the hubbub of the gale  there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman ', 'young mccarthy must be got off  however  ', ' it surprised me  ', 'how he did it i could not imagine  but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd  and right up to the steps which led to the office ', '  no  sir  i really could not   i answered firmly ', 'then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad  where all traces were lost ', ' such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet ', ' i see ', 'i whispered   did you see it  ', 'but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point  ', ' it must stop here  however   said

light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver  but holmes  hunting crop came down on the man s wrist  and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor ', 'all these i may sketch out at some future date  but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe ', 'so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice  which both hinted at a disguise  as did the bushy whiskers ', 'with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks  ', 'it cost me something in foolscap  and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings ', ' do you not think  then  that he might have been trying to straighten it  ', 'there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at

'he d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young  he told me  and it had left him with a weak throat  and a hesitating  whispering fashion of speech ', 'i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it ', 'of all these varied cases  however  i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran ', 'he asked at last pointing to a thick bell rope which hung down beside the bed  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow ', ' from the first  two facts were very obvious to me  the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony  the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home ', 'and  first  one or two

fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me  and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople  so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house ', 'that trick of staining the fishes  scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china ', 'i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply ', 'this is very interesting ', 'shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard  and  looking out of my window  i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard

shade of blue ', ' showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place ', 'it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open  ', 'i can do nothing for myself  ',

front room was plainly furnished as a sitting room and led into a small bedroom  which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves ', 'he continued  flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer

grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs  the heavy hall door banged  and from the window we could see mr  james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road ', 'i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise  the whiskers  the glasses  the voice  and i sent it to the firm  with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to

interest you  lestrade   he remarked  holding it out ', ' it is quite a pretty little problem   said he ', ' if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three o clock i should like to

favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry  and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up ', 'it seems to me  ryder  that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you ', 'the case has  in some respects  been not entirely devoid of interest  ', 'a girl of fourteen  patience moran  who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley

stepped from her carriage  was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men  who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks ', 'the puny plot of the story was so thin

myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day ', 'he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat ', ' what do you think  watson ', 'do you not see some loophole  some flaw ', 'it may well have been cause and effect ', 'that was last friday  mr  holmes  and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him  ', '

pretty diversity of opinion ', ' but  surely  it was obvious ', 'that was to some extent in favour of the accused  as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father ', 'i shall stand behind

us ', 'i thought that he was delirious ', 'i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations  and in admiring the rapid deductions  as swift as intuitions  and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him ', 'but holmes shook his head gravely ', 'by degrees mr  duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning  and then  after a time  he did not come in at all ', 'if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes  how is she to prove their authenticity  ', ' i am for west   remarked the plain clothes man ', ' my name  sir  but you have the advantage of me   said my companion quietly ', ' our quest is practically finished ', ' you seem to me to have acted all

to the stage  and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london ', ' they often vanish before the ceremony  and occasionally during the honeymoon  but i cannot call to mind anything quite so

two syllables ', '  well  really  it seems rather useless  since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion   said she sharply ', ' my dear holmes  ', 'holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar ', ' this matter  from what you say  seems to have been a shock to her also  ', 'there was no rain  as holmes had foretold  and the morning broke bright and cloudless ', 'then he handed me a yellow backed novel  and moving my chair a little sideways  that my own shadow might not fall upon the page  he begged me to read aloud to him ', 'you may then walk to the end of the street  and

opening between two rooms ', '  dear me  ', 'this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement  how long had he been with you  ', 'on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men  one of whom i recognised as peter jones  the official police agent  while the other was a long  thin  sad faced man  with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock coat ', 'down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic  but at either side and on the heaped up edges of the foot paths it still lay as white as when it fell ', 'he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled ', 'now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night  though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now  ', 'one would think they were the only geese in the world  to hear the fuss that is made over them  ', 'he burst into convulsive sobbing  with his face buried in his hands ', ' why   said my wife  pulling up her veil   it is kate whitney ', 'perhaps the villain was softened by the woman s entreaties  ', ' and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you  ', 'round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped  which was mottled all over with bloodstains ', '  i had 4 pounds a month in my last place with colonel spence munro  ', ' i had an idea that he might  and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me  ', 'they were a gang  and a rough one  too ', 'then he lit his pipe  and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling ', 'from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years  that he was a widower  and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia ', ' i started from home before six  reached leatherhead at twenty past  and came in by the first train to waterloo ', 'it is a hat of the very best quality ', ' he s quicker at climbing down holes than i am ', 'the man s business was a small one  and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations  and such an expenditure as they were at ', 'she had gone off with a man  and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband  the chances being in favour of the latter  ', 'the other dived down the hole  and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts ', 'then when you hear him retire for the night  you must open the shutters of your window  undo the hasp  put your lamp there as a signal to us  and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy ', ' i am armed  ', ' what  then  did peterson do  ', 'it is pleasant to me to observe  watson  that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up  and  i am bound to say  occasionally to embellish  you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c l bres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves  but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province  ', 'what could it be  once more ', 'the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day  or rather of the day before  for it was considerably after midnight ', ' do you know  watson   said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness   i have really some scruples as to taking you to night ', ' alas  ', 'come this way  if you please  ', 'how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately  and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl  ', 'you knew that this man horner  the plumber  had been concerned in some such matter before  and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him ', 'do you understand  ', 'your wedding was arranged  then  for the friday ', ' here are the very letters ', ' and from a noble client  ', ' but how will you look  ', 'an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door ', 'i thought  at any rate  that i should call you and give you the chance  ', ' so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action ', 'they are all typewritten ', 'sherlock holmes was a man  however  who  when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind  would go for days  and even for a week  without rest  turning it over  rearranging his facts  looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient ', 'and that was

understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person ', 'wilson  ', ' yes   said holmes  answering the look rather than the words ', ' or rather  i fancy  of that goose ', 'she will not be up  so that we shall have a clear field ', ' oh  yes ', ' and he is a man with a wooden leg  ', 'i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good night  ', 'and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him ', 'and you know where they are ', 'the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes  succinct description  but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected ', 'he was much excited  without either his gun or his hat  and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood ', 'here is a pen ', 'then i do not think that i need to detain you longer ', 'it becomes a personal matter with me now  and  if god sends me health  i shall set my hand upon this gang ',

caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out ', 'this press  as i have already explained  has got out of order  and we wish your advice upon the subject ', ' it was only a joke at first   groaned our visitor ', 'i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once  but the coachman had come in  and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait ', 'i was too shaken to go to

 yourself  in your sleep  ', ' this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter ', ' why is he silent  then  if he is innocent  ', 'i asked ', 'by the way  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall  ', 'i rushed across the bedroom  flung open the window  and looked out ', 'what a strange idea  ', ' oh  yes  plenty ', 'lestrade and i walked behind him  the detective indifferent and contemptuous  while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end

remained in the minds of the coroner s jury  ', ' yes  ', 'you cannot imagine how comical he was  and i laughed until i was quite weary ', 'it s not been fed for two days ', 'then something suddenly snapped  and your son  finding that he had the coronet in his hands  rushed back  closed the window  ascended to your room  and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and

his extraordinary powers ', 'it is the more strange  since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea ', ' it s quite too funny ', ' texas  i think  ', 'too large for easy concealment about a woman s dress ', ' i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope  and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine  ', 'you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee ', 'i look at them  and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there  ', 'the smarting of it recalled in

how about mr  hosmer angel ', 'a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me ', ' excuse me  i know everything of it ', 'he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant  hardly knowing what to say or do  i was so pleased at my own good fortune ', 'its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it ', 'the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy  and  as i knew well  he was never so truly formidable as when  for days on end  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black letter editions ', ' half dazed  i went into the station and asked about the morning train ', 'at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me  and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect ', 'and yet even here we may discriminate ', 'be one of them  and you will know all that there is to know ', 'if she can come to winchester to meet

the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy ', 'and off he went  this trusty tout  without even giving me time to thank him ', ' you think that he is dead  ', ' here is the first notice which i can find ', 'i heard a gentle sound of movement  and then all was silent once more  though the smell grew stronger ', 'for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head ', 'a

of joy our client clutched it up ', ' so it appears  ', 'my companion noiselessly closed the shutters  moved the lamp onto the table  and cast his eyes round the room ', ' i have seen the will of the

have been ', ' i cannot think  ', ' well  i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries   said holmes carelessly ', ' i think it very unlikely  ', 'suddenly  to my horror

who is on duty  ', 'you are screening your stepfather  ', 'was the remainder of the coronet at all injured  ', 'you have formed some conclusion ', 'it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name

evening he was very drunk  and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door ', 'it is wednesday ', 'if we could fly out of that window hand in hand  hover over this great city  gently remove the roofs  and peep in at the queer things which are going on  the strange coincidences  the plannings  the cross purposes  the wonderful chains of events  working through generations  and leading to the most outr  results  it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable  ', 'then i  rather imprudently  wished you good night  and started for

two souls which are so closely allied ', 'from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion ', ' yes  ', ' if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up   said he   of course you can hardly avoid publicity ', ' it is possible  ', 'we laid him upon the drawing room sofa  and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife  i did what i could to relieve his pain ', ' but you were on a friendly footing  ', 'lestrade shrugged his shoulders ', 'at last  however  the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness

bedroom ', 'his broad black hat  his baggy trousers  his white tie  his sympathetic smile  and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr  john hare alone could have equalled ',

pounds for the goodwill and interest  which wasn t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive  ', 'a few country carts were stirring  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis  but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream ', 'it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through  ', 'carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death  i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder ', 'then he did the same with the wood work with which the chamber was panelled ', 'but you see  sir  them s not our geese

house ', ' nothing  ', 'i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name ', ' these are very deep waters   said he   pray go on with your narrative  ', 'said he   where s your daughter  ', ' she walked into the breakfast room  ', ' i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron  the walls were of wood ', 'turning round we saw a little rat faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp  while breckinridge  the salesman  framed in the door of his stall  was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure ', 'that was unfortunate ', 'the fire was burning brightly  and in the grate there was a mass of black  fluffy ashes  as of burned paper  while the brass box stood open and empty beside it ', ' there was a double line of tracks of a booted man  and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet ', 'he was pacing the room swiftly  eagerly  with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him ', 'this american had started from london when he was young  and he wanted to do the old town a good turn ', ' look there  ', ' that was it   said holmes  nodding approvingly   i have no doubt of it ', ' bought  ', ' he looked surprised and  as it seemed to me  a little startled at my remark ', 'the man s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree ', 'with a boy s curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole  but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room ', ' and your mother is alive  ', 'as to holmes  i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end  with knitted brows and an abstracted air  but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it ', ' i will tell you it just as it happened  sir   said he ', 'good bye  it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening  ', 'as to mrs  st  clair s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window  he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming ', 'i tell you that ', 'at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead  where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes ', 'by the way  since you are interested in these little problems  and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences  you may be interested in this  ', ' evidently   said i   mr  wilson s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red headed league ', 'i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross ', 'in dress now  for example ', 'it was a pretty expensive joke for them  for it cost them two and thirty pounds  ', 'the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry  cooee  ', 'i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise  ', 'at first i thought that she had not recognised me  but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget   oh  my god ', ' many times  but what was a fine to me  ', ' but mr  fowler being a persevering man  as a good seaman should be  blockaded the house  and having met you succeeded by certain arguments  metallic or otherwise  in convincing you that your interests were the same as his  ', 'he asked ', ' would you ', 'he was kind to her also in his bluff  boisterous fashion  and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple ', ' the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other ', ' how many ', 'i nodded again ', 'by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me  slowly  jerkily  but  as none knew better than myself  with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp ', ' frankly  then  madam  i do not  ', ' i shall be at baker street at ten  ', 'presently she emerged from the room again  and in the light of the passage lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands ', 'i may tell you that  besides mr  rucastle  both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms  and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door ', 'it is absolutely unique  and its value can only be conjectured  but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price  ', 'it was a labyrinth of an old house  with corridors  passages  narrow winding staircases  and little low doors  the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them ', ' your sister asked for it  i suppose  ', 'i threw myself  screaming  against the door  and dragged with my nails at the lock ', 'what do you think of such a commission as that  ', 'i know that miss stoner has been here ', 'and underneath  ', '  jephro   said she   there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter  ', ' and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill  which interests me deeply  ', 'it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman  whose name has not been ascertained  who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party  alleging that she had some claim upon lord st  simon ', 'old as is the idea  however  there were one or two details which were new to me ', ' do you go out much in society  ', 'it is three now ', ' a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect   remarked holmes ', ' i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me ', ' yes  that is the crown  ', 'from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear  ', 'beside this table  on the wooden chair  sat dr  grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing gown  his bare ankles protruding beneath  and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers ', '  and be laughed at for my pains ', '  it is absolutely essential to me   said he   that i should have 50 000 pounds at once ', 'however  i must not sit gossiping here  but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self  ', 'surely your medical experience would tell you  watson  that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others  ', 'the lamps had been lit  but the blinds had not been drawn  so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch ', 'holmes laughed ', 'my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it ', 'i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you  ', ' never better ', 'for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor s knee ', 'so long  then  ', ' ah  but i was recommended to you  ', 'said he  laying down his cup   i feared as much ', 'she raised her veil as she spoke  and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation  her face all drawn and grey  with restless frightened eyes  like those of some hunted animal ', '  ah  very well  then that quite settles the matter ', 'how could you know anything of the matter  ', 'chubb lock to the door ', 'we have boxed the compass among us ', ' i never have  ', ' you look dissatisfied  ', ' you are engaged   said i   perhaps i interrupt you  ', 'was it to be in church  ', 'this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den  and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest  ', ' i hope we may clear him  miss turner   said sherlock holmes ', 'and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again   here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage  and he glared down at me with the face of a demon   i ll throw you to the mastiff  ', 'the year  87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest  of which i retain the records ', ' last monday mr  neville st  clair went into town rather earlier than usual  remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform  and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks ', ' by jove  peterson  ', ' you must act  man  or you are lost ', 'the count shrugged his broad shoulders ', 'of course i might have fled from the house  but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears ', 'when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties  ', ' the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue ', ' god help me  i would not have them ashamed of their father ', ' he is dead   cried several voices ', ' he has come back and done it ', ' there is your hat  then  and there your bird   said he ', 'kindly sign the paper where mr  fordham shows you  ', 'sherlock holmes laughed ', 'so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head ', 'good night  ', 'i have no doubt that  in spite of the repairs  you could manage there for one night  ', 'what do you deduce from that  ', 'i hurled it out of the window  and it disappeared into the thames ', '  yes  thief  ', 'ryder quivered with emotion ', 'then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st  simon ', ' certainly  madam  ', ' it was in vain to argue with him  for he was a very obstinate man ', 'i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives ', 'that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place ', 'it was all done in an instant  and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other  while the clergyman beamed on me in front ', 'i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred ', 'therein lies my m tier  and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us ', 'i had no idea ', ' it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground ', ' the rest you will leave in our hands  ', ' a fair dowry ', ' it is very essential  miss stoner   said he   that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect  ', 'i could even tell that they had been disturbed  for the woman had run back swiftly to the door  as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks  while wooden

the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle  save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red ', 'i was young ', ' he is said to be the richest

was already a dying and a desperate man ', ' very naturally not ', ' it is true ', 'ah  he s breathing now  ', ' i saw it in a paper   explained the american ', ' yes  my stepfather ', 'who could come to night ', ' she was never happy at home  miss alice wasn t  from the time that her father married again ', ' i am saved ', ' they have but one retreat   whispered holmes ', 'of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer  but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record

enough to go in for felony with impunity ', 'now  by the merest chance  his wife received a telegram upon this same monday  very shortly after his departure  to the effect that a small parcel of

the dealer s  jem  ', ' what do you say  dear  ', 'i ask you not merely because my friend dr  watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious

sprang up and lit the lamp  but nothing was to be seen in the room ', 'she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light  one hand upon the door  one half raised in her eagerness  her body

rather disconnected  i fear  and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak ', ' i think  watson   he remarked at last   that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this  ', 'then he walked slowly up the street  and then down again to the corner  still looking keenly at the houses ', 'said our new visitor  taking a step forward and

obliged  ', ' excellent ', 'the case would then never go into court at all  ', 'i should not stay here ', ' you speak of danger ', ' that is a possible solution  in fact  as matters stand  it is the most probable one ', 'anybody bringing      that will do   said holmes ', '  what do you call purely nominal  ', 'he found  as so many more have done  that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of  and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug  an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives ', 'said he ', ' why  what do you mean  ', 'i see the direction in

me neither favourably nor the reverse ', ' one of his hands  ', 'i told my pal what i had done  for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to ', ' you reasoned it out beautifully   i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration ', '  death   said he  and rising from the table he retired to his room  leaving me palpitating with horror ', ' my name is sherlock holmes ', ' there are a few of us

secret was a disgraceful one ', 'i took advantage now of my attainments ', ' there is the gravel drive  and there are the rose bushes where i lay ', 'again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland ', 'it must have been this morning  or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger ', 'holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic

examined and retained ', 'and  what will you take for the geese  ', 'and now here is my pocket petrarch  and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action ', ' and why did you wish to see me  ', ' and what else  ', ' he s gone for the dog  ', 'i could see that she was pretty  and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich

the clock makes it a few minutes after four  i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client ', ' that would be unnecessary ', ' ah  and what did you gather from this allusion to a band  a speckled band  ', ' then what has happened to him  ', ' well  i don t know why not   said the inspector ', ' but the letter had also a greater distance to come  ', 'yes  i see ', 'then  after we had sat down for ten minutes or so  she rose hurriedly  muttered some words of apology  and left the room ', 'and the rucastles go out to night  ', 'the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant ', 'indeed  i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation  and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation ', ' he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning  knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me ', 'i have it here and i will read it to you                            the copper beeches  near winchester ', 'your news of this morning  however  may open his lips  ', 'i asked when i had finished ', ' mr  hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back ', 'any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss  for there are no beryls in the world to match these  and it would be impossible to replace them ', 'there is nothing more to be said or to be done to night  so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men  ', ' i ve wasted time enough   said lestrade  rising ', 'however  it was too late to alter the matter now  so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work ', 'and holmes  fears came to be realised  for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman  the sinister german  or the morose englishman ', 'there were six of us  and we had a wild  free life of it  sticking up a station from time to time  or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings ', ' i will get her to show me  ', ' yes  it did ', ' you must know   said he   that i am an orphan and a bachelor  residing alone in lodgings in london ', ' murdered  ', 'a sandwich and a cup of coffee  and then off to violin land  where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony  and there are no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums  ', ' well  and what happened when mr  windibank  your stepfather  returned to france  ', ' that is it on the dressing table  ', ' in heaven s name  what for  ', 'male costume is nothing new to me ', ' my dear fellow  is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case  ', 'there were  it is true  some blood stains upon his right shirt sleeve  but he pointed to his ring finger  which had been cut near the nail  and explained that the bleeding came from there  adding that he had been to the window not long before  and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source ', ' indeed ', 'yours faithfully  jephro rucastle  ', 'now  mr ', ' the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn ', 'the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round  with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge ', 'has a white splash of acid upon his forehead  ', 'his defence was one of absolute ignorance  and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone  his lodger  and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman s clothes ', 'the old man sank his face in his hands ', ' this discovery  and the evident confusion which the cripple showed  made the inspector realise that the matter was serious ', ' what  sir ', 'you may go to any expense which you think necessary ', 'every morning i was there at ten  and every afternoon i left at two ', 'you may walk to the cab  and i shall be with you presently  ', 'the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes ', 'with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us ', 'most of his time he would spend in his room  with the door locked upon the inside  but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand  screaming out that he was afraid of no man  and that he was not to be cooped up  like a sheep in a pen  by man or devil ', ' you have made your position very clear to me   said holmes ', '  hampshire ', 'we shall want you to come to night by the last train  ', ' your reasoning is certainly plausible  ', 'at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect  with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock coat  a picture of offended dignity ', 'i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you  ', 'i asked ', 'but that was not quite good enough  mr  holmes ', 'now her marriage would mean  of course  the loss of a hundred a year  so what does her stepfather do to prevent it ', 'oh  mr  holmes  i wish you would do as much for me ', 'you made some small job in my lady s room  you and your confederate cusack  and you managed that he should be the man sent for ', ' the man who wrote it was presumably well to do   i remarked  endeavouring to imitate my companion s processes ', 'there you are ', 'lestrade laughed indulgently ', 'she had hardly said the words when young mr  mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood  and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper ', 'i imagine that you saw all that i did  ', 'then he passed his handkerchief over his brow  set his lips tight  and turned his face towards us ', 'his orders were to stay in the house  ', 'data  ', 'they are the devil s pet baits ', 'iii ', '  in the case of another   said he   the objection might be fatal  but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours ', 'the first had walked both ways  but the other had run swiftly  and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot  it was obvious that he had passed after the other ', ' ah ', 'interjected holmes ', ' well  she had a slate coloured  broad brimmed straw hat  with a feather of a brickish red ', ' some ten or twelve  but none which present any feature of interest ', ' i am endeavouring to tell you everything  mr  holmes  which may have any bearing upon the case  but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear  ', ' no  i never heard of her using it ', 'i was frightened of the house  of the man  of the woman  of the servants  even of the child ', 'it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way    have you a couple of days to spare ', 'there must have been several in it  and they must have been men of resource and determination ', 'come  now  we shall see who agrees with you ', '  where could i find him  ', 'one was an old woman  whose name is not mentioned  and the other was william crowder  a game keeper in the employ of mr  turner ', ' there are three men waiting for him at the door   said holmes ', ' he might  ', 'this is my friend and colleague  dr  watson ', 'it was as well for his resolution  perhaps  for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist ', 'he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple minded nonconformist clergyman ', ' and you did very wisely   said holmes ', 'i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper  which contained a verbatim account of the inquest ', 'there was something else which she would fain have said  and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor s room  but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words ', 'you d be as warm  maybe  if you were as pestered as i am ', 'i left the breakfast table  and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key  which must have belonged to the attic  in one hand  and a small brass box  like a cashbox  in the other ', 'i heard that  and i came down  ', ' your boy  arthur  went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts ', 'so ', 'good bye  and be brave  for if you will do what i have told you  you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you  ', 'i snatched it up and examined it ', 'she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs  on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants  escapade with her wooden legged lover  which was all perfectly true ', 'slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street  and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend s arm in mine  and to get away from the scene of uproar ', 'about two in the morning  then  i was awakened by some sound in the house ', 'it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes  ', ' when i arrived at the house   continued holmes   i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me ', '  my name   said he   is mr  duncan ross  and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor ', 'making our way among the trees  we reached the lawn  crossed it  and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child  who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness ', ' very good ', 'the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents  but as  by mrs  st  clair s story  he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband s appearance at the window  he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime ', 'you just read it for yourself  sir  ', 'still  of course  i never dared to leave the room for an instant  for i was not sure when he might come  and the billet was such a good one  and suited me so well  that i would not risk the loss of it ', ' the circumstances are of great delicacy  and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe ', 'save  perhaps  that ', 'asked holmes ', ' to clotilde lothman von saxe meningen  second daughter of the king of scandinavia ', 'i have not treated her ungenerously  and she had no just cause of complaint against me  but you know what women are  mr  holmes ', 'the daughter was of a good  amiable disposition  but affectionate and warm hearted in her ways  so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages  and her little income  she would not be allowed to remain single long ', ' i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird ', ' we re hunting in couples again  doctor  you see   said jones in his consequential way ', '  well   said i   the gentleman at no ', 'and no later than this morning ', ' i see many objections to any such theory  ', ' excellent ', 'it is a perfectly overpowering impulse  and i have more than once taken advantage of it ', ' my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present  and i knew that she was always as good as her word ', ' did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed  ', ' not social  then  ', 'when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him  and finding that he would not tell me the story  i told it to him  on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me ', 'you are too timid in drawing your inferences  ', 'i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement ', 'there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 11 15  ', 'i fainted when it was done  and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time ', 'it had cleared in the morning  and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city ', 'he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready ', 'there is not an instant to be lost ', 'his boots  too  might be told from their traces  ', 'i shall look into the matter between this and then ', 'there he is  all safe and sound ', 'it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro  and that she has known the bridegroom for some years ', ' but his lameness  ', 'from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character  with a thick  hanging lip  and a long  straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy ', ' i was not and am not sure which  but i knew that the ship must have an american origin  ', 'forgery  ', 'i think that we may judge lord st  simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position ', 'it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone  ', 'all over the countryside  away to the rolling hills around aldershot  the little red and grey roofs of the farm steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage ', ' mrs  rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature ', 'in an instant his strange headgear began to move  and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent ', 'he was not a popular man  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners  but he had  as far as i know  no active enemies ', 'he walked up to the sideboard  and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously  washing it down with a long draught of water ', ' yes ', 'as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him  and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers ', ' sarasate plays at the st  james s hall this afternoon   he remarked

had caused the disturbance  has actually been arrested ', ' where  indeed  ', ' you did it very nicely  doctor   he remarked ', ' having once spotted my man  it was easy to get corroboration ', 'my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature  which  of course  inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it ', 'i should become the laughing stock of scotland yard  ', 'the same post brought me a letter from westhouse   marbank  of fenchurch street  to say that the description tallied in every

come round to my view  for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right ', 'there was a long silence  during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire ', ' you have  no doubt  already formed your conclusions from the newspapers   he said ', ' i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions   he said ', 'they were all horrible to me ', 'one day  however  as i ascended the stair  i met mr  rucastle coming out through this door  his keys in his hand  and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round  jovial man to whom i was accustomed ', 'it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems ',

can do nothing until seven o clock ', ' you forget that i know nothing about it  ', 'the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist ', 'on the right side was a small wooden thicket  which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door  and forming the tradesmen s entrance ', 'the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come ', 'then he sealed it and

way down  but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery ', ' and she would need to be   said holmes gravely ', ' you will  however  i am sure  excuse me for taking an obvious precaution  ', 'i clambered out upon the sill  but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me ', ' do not lose an instant ', 'my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match  and we are to be married in the course of the spring ', 'i deduced a ventilator  ', ' the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and

up from him  silent  motionless  with the light shining upon his strong set aquiline features ', 'asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way ', ' from india  ', 'i never saw a more

hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged ', 'to holmes  as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes  very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass ', ' no bad  ', 'she asked ', ' i am afraid so ', 'the gentleman  however  seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face  opened a pocket book and took out a note ', 'oh  do  do take my word for it that he is innocent ', 'as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle  such as my sister described  and a few moments later a clanging sound  as if a mass of metal had fallen ', 'holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary  heavy lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature  while i sat opposite to him  and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us ', 'i took a few of my friends into the secret  however  and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields ', ' on the contrary  watson  you can see everything ', ' i cannot admire his taste   i remarked   if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with

neither of us care for it  ', ' you have it  sir  just as it happened  ', 'what could it be ', ' i will soon make it clear to you   said she   and i d have done so before now if i could ha  got out

appeared surprised at his own arrest  or feigned indignation at it  i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious  because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances  and

serious accident during the night ', ' have you her photograph  ', 'he sat at my side in silence all the time  and i was aware  more than once when i glanced in his direction  that he was looking at

him  ', 'would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr  hosmer angel  ', 'my practice had steadily increased  and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station

this i drove one of the birds  a fine big one  white  with a barred tail ', 'he rushed fiercely forward  and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness ', ' tut ', 'he stepped swiftly forward  seized the poker  and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands ', ' but what harm can there be in that  ', ' it came here  ', '  breckinridge  of covent garden  ', 'miss stoner did so  and holmes

light and being satisfied with such a result ', 'it only remains  therefore  to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face ',

and would have your opinion  though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done ', 'that will be next monday  ', 'bankers  safes had been forced before now  and why should not mine be ', 'i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning  homeward bound to savannah ', ' my stepfather s business papers  ', ' i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk  mr  holmes   he said ', ' yes  it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so ', 'finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall ', ' yes ', 'here is the stone  the stone came from the goose  and the goose came from mr  henry baker  the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you ', ' i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee ', 'i had let myself go  and was hanging by the hands to the sill  when his blow fell ', '  oh   says she   we ve set yours aside for you  jem s bird  we call it ', 'he was  as the inspector had said  extremely dirty  but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness ', 'boots had then run down the lane  and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt ', 'if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets  ', 'it must be where she can lay her hands upon it ', 'the blow was struck from immediately behind  and yet was upon the left side ', ' and now  ', 'i cried ', 'it had escaped my memory ', 'it is my belief  watson  founded upon my experience  that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside  ', 'i don t know him ', 'but if you are found again  then all must come out ', ' and now there is only she to be described ', 'he saw her stealthily open the window  hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom  and then closing it once more hurry back to her room  passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain ', ' oh  to the other side of the west end ', 'it was headed   march  1869   and beneath were the following enigmatical notices    4th ', 'i glanced at him again  and he seemed to know what i was thinking  for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still ', 'i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son ', 'i believe that she is capable of heroic self sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her  ', ' then i do not see the point  ', 'in this i was asked to sit  and then mr  rucastle  walking up and down on the other side of the room  began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to ', ' one  ', 'we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over ', ' the knees of his trousers  ', 'you saw her return by the kitchen door  i presume  ', ' well  i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden  ', 'but he is a dirty scoundrel  ', ' my dear holmes  ', 'it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track ', 'he had trained it  probably by the use of the milk which we saw  to return to him when summoned ', ' i have no doubt that i am very stupid  but i must confess that i am unable to follow you ', ' what can you not understand  ', 'but among them was sir george burnwell ', 'he ran up and down  sometimes losing  sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech  the largest tree in the neighbourhood ', '  there is a drive  then  ', 'and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting room behind me  and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand  as it seemed to me at the time  though the future only could show how strange it was to be ', 'lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found  and  indeed  so moist was the ground  that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man ', ' last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw  to my horror and astonishment  that my wife was standing in the street  with her eyes fixed full upon me ', 'cried hatherley  in intense excitement ', 'my friend was an enthusiastic musician  being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit ', 'i am at my wit s end ', 'after all  i thought  we are not injuring her ', ' i am delighted to see you   said she  pressing my hand warmly ', 'having once made up my mind  you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof ', 'she was a nonentity ', 'there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify ', ' oh  you must not discourage me  mr  holmes ', 'it is an old trick  ', 'if she were ill used  then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance ', ' i am to be neutral  ', ' mr  fowler was a very kind spoken  free handed gentleman   said mrs  toller serenely ', '  what then  ', ' at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance  ', ' a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it ', ' no  ', ' i answered that i had not ', 'do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it  ', ' then how many are there  ', 'i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty guinea fee  and what have i gained  ', 'having found the ash  i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it ', 'seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable  i left him and returned towards hatherley farm ', 'you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me  ', ' i could not sleep that night ', 'i shook my head ', 'we have had some skirmishes  but we had never set eyes upon each other before ', ' your red headed idea was very new and effective  ', ' the gentleman i describe  ', 'he looked at me with a last long  questioning gaze  and then  pressing my hand in a cold  dank grasp  he hurried from the room ', ' about a month then  ', 'i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman s face ', 'he stammered ', ' i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until  some time later  i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 pounds ', 'we are but preventing her from injuring another ', 'he wore rather baggy grey shepherd s check trousers  a not over clean black frock coat  unbuttoned in the front  and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain  and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament ', ' but of what society  ', 'i have no doubt at all that he had left it there ', 'i implored the colonel to let me out  but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries ', 'both these witnesses depose that mr  mccarthy was walking alone ', 'i went to my work as usual at ten o clock  but the door was shut and locked  with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack ', ' imitated  ', ' it is clear that mrs  toller knows more about this matter than anyone else  ', 'might i ask you a question or two  ', 'posted to day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ', 'it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight  so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it ', 'for you  mr  merryweather  the stake will be some 30 000 pounds  and for you  jones  it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands  ', 'i think myself that it is a page from some private diary ', ' no  we don t keep a cat ', 'now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den  and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st  clair ', 'consider what is involved by your theory ', 'mary and i stay at home ', 'and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view ', ' in view of your health  nothing ', 'holmes shook his clenched hands in the air ', '  well  it is a little awkward  for i have a business already   said i ', 'it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide ', 'my groom and my page sleep out of the house  and may be set aside altogether ', 'i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine  ', 'he gathered up the garments  thrust them into the bag  and made for the door ', 'a flush stole over miss sutherland s face  and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket ', ' it was from the reigning family of holland  though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you  who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems  ', ' pray take this chair by the fire  mr  baker ', 'mark that point ', 'once only had i known him to fail  in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph  but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four  and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet  i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel ', ' sold out of geese  i see   continued holmes  pointing at the bare slabs of marble ', '  no  i know no one in these parts  ', 'you thief ', ' and sit in the dark  ', 'i cried   this is a terrible injury ', 'we will talk about that ', 'i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse ', 'you did not see anyone else in the room  ', 'our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman  obese  pompous  and slow ', 'having done this  you must at once put the box out upon the sundial  as directed ', 'his name is hugh boone  and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city ', ' very murderous indeed  ', 'it is a bijou villa  with a garden at the back  but built out in front right up to the road  two stories ', 'was it not extraordinary ', ' her banker or her lawyer ', 'between a slop shop and a gin shop  approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave  i found the den of which i was in search ', 'she had a considerable sum of money  not less than 1000 pounds a year  and this she bequeathed to dr  roylott entirely while we resided with him  with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage ', 'we are at present  doctor  as no doubt you have divined  in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks ', 'now  when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning  and knock sleepy people up out of their beds  i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate ', 'said my friend  blowing blue rings into the air ', 'yes  17 king edward street  near st ', 'his brain is as cunning as his fingers  and though we meet signs of him at every turn  we never know where to find the man himself ', 'i am sorry to give you such a two edged thing  but i can t say what turn things are going to take ', ' they are coiners on a large scale  and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver  ', ' we shall soon set matters right  i have no doubt ', 'he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman ', ' i am immensely indebted to you ', 'i lay listening with all my ears ', ' yes  ', 'frank said that he would go and make his pile  too  and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa  so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived ', 'it is her carriage ', ' so i am ', 'he slipped his key into the lock  and we all very quietly entered the cell ', 'wait in patience   neville  ', ' i confess that i have been as blind as a mole  but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all  ', 'a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled  who had been sitting in the window  rose as we entered ', 'it may stop his gossip ', '  yes  our little place is quite out in the country ', ' i could do with much less than that  mr  holmes  but you understand that as long as i live at home i don t wish to be a burden to them  and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them ', 'can you not find the advertisement  mr ', 'that s right ', 'i left him then  still puffing at his black clay pipe  with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland ', ' you have been recommended to me  mr  hatherley  as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret  ', 'on the inside of the cover was a paper label  with the initials of k  k  k  repeated upon it  and  letters  memoranda

suggestive ', 'becher s  ', ' but he might be a bachelor  ', ' well  there seems to me to be only one possible solution ', 'i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear  and the sight sent a chill to my own heart ', 'it s hard to say his age ', 'off i set to him  and after much chaffering i got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece ', 'it arrived upon christmas morning  in company with a good fat goose  which is  i have no doubt  roasting at this moment in front of peterson s fire ', 'holmes  ', ' my dear fellow  there lies the problem ', 'here is where the party with the lodge keeper came  and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body ', 'all will come well ', 'it is in the personal column of the morning post  and dates  as you see  some weeks back   a marriage has been arranged   it says   and will  if rumour is correct  very shortly take place  between lord robert st  simon  second son of the duke of balmoral  and miss hatty doran  the only daughter of aloysius doran ', '  oh   said he   his name was william morris ', 'during that time i have lived happily at horsham  and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family  and that it had ended with the last generation ', 'that  however  i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement  ', ' you interest me extremely   said holmes ', 'and  i say  peterson  just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me  for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring  ', 'we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked  ', ' we have at least an hour before us   he remarked   for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed ', ' but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion ', 'far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock  which boomed out every quarter of an hour ', 'cried miss hunter ', ' it certainly sounds feasible  ', ' have you never    said sherlock holmes  bending forward and sinking his voice   have you never heard of the ku klux klan  ', ' the landlord of the alpha  ', ' indeed ', 'so and so  of ballarat  ', 'he ran when he saw his father on the ground ', 'that is very interesting ', 'but have you never been prosecuted for begging  ', 'where  ', ' and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious  ', 'which was a usual signal between my father and myself ', 'i hope that i have made myself clear  ', 'i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room  ', 'pray let me have the details  ', ' not at all ', ' my name   answered our visitor   is probably familiar to your ears ', 'he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets ', ' where  then  is my wife  ', 'i have no doubt that i am myself to blame ', 'to be left till called for  ', 'there was little difficulty in entering the grounds  for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall ', ' oh  he gives no trouble ', ' you can understand   said holmes suavely   that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours  ', ' yes  all  ', 'of these bedrooms the first is dr  roylott s  the second my sister s  and the third my own ', 'you fail  however  to reason from what you see ', ' you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct  and if she died from some sudden fright  ', ' i should not be surprised if that were he ', 'bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre ', 'you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in ', ' coarse writing   murmured holmes ', ' hold up  man  or you ll be into the fire ', 'those  i think  were the main points of my analysis  ', 'this dress does implicate miss flora millar  ', 'just as i arrived the door was opened  and we were shown up together to holmes  room ', 'xi ', 'what can this be  ', 'she writhed as one who is in terrible pain  and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed ', 'as he stepped up to the cab  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly   drive like the devil   he shouted   first to gross   hankey s in regent street

upon the subject  ', 'he was a small  wiry  sunburnt man  clean shaven  with a sharp face and alert manner ', 'it was a perfect day  with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens ', 'it ran  if i remember right   sent the pips to a  b  and c   that is  sent the society s warning to them ', 'sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined ', ' i could not bear the disgrace ', ' yes  and a most remarkable bird it proved ', ' my last client of the sort was a king  ', 'my father had a small factory at coventry  which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling ', ' stolen  then  ', 'don t you dare to meddle with my affairs ', '  they may do what they like  but i ll checkmate them still   said he with an oath ', 'i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad

looked sadly at my companion ', 'sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily ', 'passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river  and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street ', '  and what salary do you ask  ', ' i cannot as yet see any connection  ', 'he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation  with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands ', 'her boots i didn t observe ', 'from that appointment he never came back alive ', 'i am but thirty now  ', 'you can understand that  living the life which i have described  we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position ', ' well  i have been twenty seven years in the force  but this really takes the cake  ', 'having laid out all these luxuries  my two visitors vanished away  like the genii of the arabian nights  with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address ', 'ferguson remained outside  and the colonel ushered me in ', 'he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards  ', 'i have had nothing since breakfast  ', 'it was a delicate part which i had to play then  for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal  and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter ', 'then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings ', 'what does her clever stepfather do then ', 'this is more interesting than it promised to be  quite dramatic  in fact  ', 'he throws it out  and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below  and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared  ', 'mrs  hudson has been knocked up  she retorted upon me  and i on you  ', 'you may know the strict principles of her family ', 'i asked ', ' well  i followed you to your door  and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr  sherlock holmes ', 'we know something of saxe coburg square ', ' i suppose   said holmes   that when mr  windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball  ', 'you have made two blunders in as many minutes ', '  there are three missing ', 'having taken the printed description ', ' if you remember  monday was an exceedingly hot day  and mrs  st  clair walked slowly  glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab  as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself ', 'i went out  as if on some commission  and i made for my sister s house ', ' yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound  and that the door  window  and chimney are impassable  then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end  ', ' i am afraid   said i   that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case  ', ' and mademoiselle s address  ', ' all right   said holmes quietly ', 'vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful  so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me ', 'spies and thieves ', ' he is a hard man   she said   and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength  ', 'should it prove to be an interesting case  you would  i am sure  wish to follow it from the outset ', 'then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear ', ' perhaps we may make them less so  ', 'think of the deeds of hellish cruelty  the hidden wickedness which may go on  year in  year out  in such places  and none the wiser ', 'i whispered   what on earth are you doing in this den  ', 'said he as he took it up   pondicherry postmark ', 'for my part  i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it  ', ' i do  ', 'after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners  camp had been attacked by apache indians  and there was my frank s name among the killed ', 'the husband was a teetotaler  there was no other woman  and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife  which  you will allow  is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller ', 'round this corner were three doors in a line  the first and third of which were open ', ' indeed   said holmes ', ' the goose  mr  holmes ', ' two years have passed since then  and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever ', 'i gave a cry of surprise  threw up my arms to cover my face  and  rushing to my confidant  the lascar  entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me ', ' quite so   he answered  lighting a cigarette  and throwing himself down into an armchair ', 'i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers  ', 'these flat brims curled at the edge came in then ', 'she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it ', ' certainly  ', 'said holmes sternly ', ' you see  but you do not observe ', 'i wasn t best pleased  mr  holmes  when she married again so soon after father s death  and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself ', 'i ordered her to say nothing  but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready ', 'all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me ', ' i will try ', 'a slow and heavy step  which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage  paused immediately outside the door ', 'it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening  and ran thus    dear mr  holmes   i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess ', 'holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy faced  white aproned landlord ', ' your hands  my dear sir ', 'sir  i can stand this strain no longer  i shall go mad if it continues ', 'his slow  limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude  and yet his hard  deep lined  craggy features  and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character ', 'the  cooee  ', 'no sound came from within  and at the silence holmes  face clouded over ', ' you know my method ', ' but why are you not conducting the case from baker street  ', 'pray give me the results of your newspaper selections  ', 'it lay between that and her bedroom  and i was determined to see which ', 'i shall not say another word about this business  since you have chosen to insult me ', 'then here are the father s feet as he paced up and down ', 'it is a good seven miles from eyford station  ', ' he is still with you  ', ' he disappeared so suddenly  ', 'there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back  and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco prussian war ', 'retired from operatic stage  ha ', 'a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger ', 'i fear that i bore you with these details  but i have to let you see my little difficulties  if you are to understand the situation  ', 'the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me  and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india  i felt that i was probably on the right track ', ' then i shall certainly come  ', 'there could be no possible reason ', 'was there a police station anywhere near ', 'i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart  of whom you had already spoken to me  and inquiry showed it was so ', 'i feared to refer them to you  however  as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters  ', ' of course you are ', 'cried the banker with an ashen face ', 'he is not a bad fellow  though an absolute imbecile in his profession ', 'the crate upon which i sit contains 2 000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil ', 'now  if you cared to apply  mr  wilson  you would just walk in  but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds  ', ' ha  ', ' he has every requirement ', 'then i thought of you  mr  holmes ', 'i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room  and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has  perhaps  fluttered out from among the others  and in that way has escaped destruction ', 'of course  that is only just for the time ', '  pooh  ', 'my attention was speedily drawn  as i have already remarked to you  to this ventilator  and to the bell rope which hung down to the bed ', 'what a week she must have spent  ', 'i have a fairly long list at present  ', 'it is well thought of  ', 'it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before  but a promise of secrecy was made at the time  from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given ', 'is it possible that even now  when i give you these results  you are unable to see how they are attained  ', ' it was too far for me to go  weak and ill as i was ', 'he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again ', ' was the photograph a cabinet  ', ' you may place considerable confidence in mr  holmes  sir   said the police agent loftily ', ' bring me the books  bill   said he ', ' but you have no notion as to what it could have been  ', 'and he said that i had nothing fit to wear  when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer ', 'the woman was standing in the aperture  the darkness of the hall behind her  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face ', 'sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle ', ' the coroner  did your father make any statement to you before he died ', 'i do not know at what hour he came in  but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other  as fresh and trim as possible ', 'my wife was on a visit to her mother s  and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street ', ' they seem to have been of a most interesting character  dummy bell ropes  and ventilators which do not ventilate ', ' i think that there you ask a little too much   responded his lordship ', 'who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison ', ' which are  ', ' i have spent the whole day   said he   over lloyd s registers and files of the old papers  following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in  83 ', ' i wish you were all at the devil together ', 'have you a cab  ', ' good heavens ', ' i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master s affairs ', ' are they not fresh and beautiful  ', 'sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy chair and  sitting beside him  patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy  soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ ', 'do not dream of going  watson  for i very much prefer having a witness  if only as a check to my own memory  ', 'i have already arranged what is to occur ', ' i am glad to hear you say so   said holmes gravely ', 'i soon found briony lodge ', 'when i remembered that you had seen her at that window  and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again  my conjecture became a certainty ', ' yes  ', 'by jove  ', ' well  you know father didn t like anything of the sort ', ' mrs  st  clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window  and she was escorted home in a cab by the police  as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations ', 'this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie  ', 'it was  indeed  our friend the financier ', ' i say that i have solved it  ', 'he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro  droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words ', ' he is asleep   said he ', ' yes  ', 'up to a late hour last night  however  nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady ', 'i determined  therefore  that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me  so that it might never be really out of my reach ', 'perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him  ', ' i have come for advice  ', ' our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase ', 'to the best of his belief  the father was actually in sight at the time  and the son was following him ', 'dr  roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran ', 'i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully ', 'too little  if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury  too much  if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr  as a dying reference to a rat  and the incident of the vanishing cloth ', ' good evening  mr  james windibank   said holmes ', 'i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months ', 'there is a woodcock  i believe ', ' but i am all in the dark  ', ' ah  watson   said holmes  smiling   perhaps you would not be very

asked ', 'he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him  ', 'for example  you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room  ', 'i took the paper

thought it was his ghost at first  but when i looked again there he was still  with a kind of question in his eyes  as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him ', 'here is her carriage at

conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine ', 'i have  as you know  devoted some attention to this  and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe  cigar

letter on the table waiting for him ', 'said my wife  looking across at me ', 'the man who entered was young  some two and twenty at the outside  well groomed and trimly clad  with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing ', ' oh  yes  mr  holmes ', 'this year our good host  windigate by name  instituted a goose club  by which  on consideration of some few pence every week  we

of hosmer again ', 'sherlock holmes was well known to the force  and the two constables at the door saluted him ', 'with an apology for my intrusion  i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me ', ' you hear ', ' what is the young man s own account of the matter  ', 'it was a homely little room  with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace  after the fashion of old country houses ', ' none  ', 'her young womanhood had  i knew  been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions ', '  she came in just now by the back door ', 'your task is confined to that ', 'folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light house ', ' what of the rat  then  ', 'it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose ', ' we have got to the deductions and the inferences   said lestrade  winking at me ', 'though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb  i knew that my own fate was sealed ', ' i have my revolver   said i ', ' an elderly man  i presume  ', 'why should she hand it over to anyone else ', 'insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories  instead of theories to suit facts ', 'i think  watson  that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready  ', ' i will do so  and i must be quick  for i have promised mr  rucastle to be back before three ', 'here you are  peterson  run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers  ', 'i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them  on promising him that there would be no prosecution ', 'there was but one way for it ', 'but this time i was set on going  and i would go  for what right had he to prevent ', 'this is only where we compress it ', 'this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside  and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness ', 'it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol  and his father did not know where he was ', 'whoa  there  whoa  ', 'god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he ', '  oh  merely a couple of hundred a year  but the work is slight  and it need not interfere very much with one s other occupations  ', ' i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist  and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor  while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand  while she held a candle in her right ', ' it is our task to find that out   replied holmes   so now  if you please  mr  holder  we will set off for streatham together  and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details  ', 'i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter  but had become a public one  since the ruined coronet was national property ', ' the grass was growing under it ', 'but then  as i used to say to mother  a woman wants her own circle to begin with  and i had not got mine yet  ', 'great lord of mercy  ', 'he cried  throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion ', 'i have seen young mccarthy  ', 'mr  rucastle seemed to be a very kind  good natured man ', 'you are doing

my soul ', 'oh  don t bring it into court ', 'never let yourself doubt upon that point ', 'i have taken you fully into my confidence now  mr  hatherley  and i have shown you how i trust you  ', '  that s all right   said he  coming back ', 'she had married a man named oakshott  and lived in brixton road  where she fattened fowls for the market ', 'pray what is your own theory as to what took place  ', ' dirty  ', 'his cry brought back his son  but i had gained the cover of the wood  though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight ', 'he opened the case  and there  imbedded in soft  flesh coloured velvet  lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named ', 'i asked as i entered ', ' so i heard ', 'let us now explore the parts which lie behind it  ', 'it is the first saturday night for seven and twenty years that i have not had my rubber  ', 'k  k    and then  put the papers on the sundial   ', ' i met him first at the gasfitters  ball

could see out of the window  ', ' yes  the lodge keeper brought it up ', 'i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible  so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences  ', ' no ', 'holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied ', 'now turn that up in the ledger  ', 'have you good authority for what you say  ', ' holmes   i said   you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape  and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him ', 'he was a late riser  as a rule  and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven  i blinked up at him in some surprise  and perhaps just a little resentment  for i was myself regular in my habits ', ' this has been done   said i  examining the wound   by a very heavy and sharp instrument  ', 'it seemed strange talk for a wedding morning  but what has happened since gives a meaning to it  ', 'i am a widower and have an only son  arthur ', 'and so you won t cut your hair  ', 'colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door ', ' is he not a beauty  ', 'said holmes  sinking back in deep thought ', 'i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you  ', ' save  perhaps  the sign of four  ', 'better make it out for 4000 pounds  ', 'outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows ', 'then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand  he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words    the least sound would be fatal to our plans  ', ' the matter was perfectly simple ', 'there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience  ', 'one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled  but had refused to credit that it was his mistress  believing her to be with the company ', 'he overdid it ', 'her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger ', ' you will excuse me for not waiting for you   said he   i have  i foresee  a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw s  ', 'we waited  all curiosity  until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story ', ' i shall jot down the facts ', 'where does the thing come from  ', 'presently he came to himself once more  very weary and pale looking ', 'the  g  with the small  t  stands for  gesellschaft   which is the german for  company  ', 'as we approached  the door flew open  and a little blonde woman stood in the opening  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists ', ' i think that it is very probable  ', 'sherlock holmes hailed a four wheeler which was passing ', 'i think  perhaps  it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play  ', 'it grew broader  and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand  which she held above her head  pushing her face forward and peering at us ', 'within was a small  square room  in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ', 'the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back ', '  one child  one dear little romper just six years old ', 'that is quite settled   said he  rising and putting his lens in his pocket ', ' is toller still drunk  ', 'if they fire  watson  have no compunction about shooting them down  ', 'you  of course  saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice ', 'he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand ', 'i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark ', ' and you may expect us early in the afternoon ', 'i want the doctor s advice and help  too ', ' i cannot say that i have  ', 'the name was strange to him ', ' by train from waterloo  ', 'the alarm  however  was given  and  by the aid of the water police  the body was eventually recovered ', ' now  then  mister   said he  with his head cocked and his arms akimbo   what are you driving at ', 'as evening drew in  the storm grew higher and louder  and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney ', 'it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this ', 'but how on earth      oh  tut  tut ']\n"
